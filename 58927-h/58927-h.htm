<h2>ARTICLE I.<br />
<span class="smaller">UTILITY OF PHRENOLOGY.</span></h2>

<p><em>Phrenology is useful, because it forms the most correct basis of a
system of mental philosophy.</em></p>

<p>In a previous number of this Journal (see Art. I, page 161), we
entered somewhat at length upon the discussion of the above proposition.
We there contrasted the merits of phrenology, as the <em>true
science of the mind</em>, with other systems of mental philosophy, particularly
Dugald Stewart’s. We pointed out several important defects
which have hitherto existed in every system of mental science. We
stated that all writers on the philosophy of the mind had committed
the following mistakes. First, <em>they leave out of view almost entirely
all connection of the mind with the brain</em>; and, secondly, <em>they make
their own individual consciousness the chief and principal source of
information</em>. And that, from these two radical defects in their premises,
they have fallen into numerous errors. Among others, <em>they do
not recognise all the primitive faculties of the mind</em>; and throughout
all their writings, <em>they confound primitive faculties of the mind with
modes of activity</em>.</p>

<p>Another radical defect in the systems of previous writers on mental
science is, <em>When they admit and treat of the elementary faculties of
the mind, they consider them merely as existing by themselves, and
disregard almost entirely the influence of combination</em>.</p>

<p>This defect is similar to what would appear in that system of
chemistry which should contain only a physical description of
elements of matter, without saying any thing of the various substances
which they form in combination. Thus the chemist might
describe oxygen by itself. He might say it is a gas, colourless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
heavier than common air, a supporter of combustion and animal life,
and many other things equally important, interesting, and true; and
if such facts were all that is known of this substance, they should be
received and appreciated according to their value. But how much is
added to our knowledge, when we are informed that oxygen enters
into combination with almost every other element of matter? That
in one combination it forms the deadly poison; in another, the refreshing
cordial. That united with nitrogen in one proportion, it constitutes
the air we breathe; in another, it forms the nitrous oxyde, a
substance producing the most remarkable effects of exhilaration; in a
third proportion, the nitrous oxyde, which, coming in contact with
our lungs, produces instant death; and in a fourth, one of the most
powerful agents in nature. That with hydrogen it forms the valuable
substance called water; and in other various combinations, acids so
valuable in the arts and all the economy of civilised life.</p>

<p>Much likewise might be said, which would be interesting and true,
of acids—of their general properties—their sour taste—their effects
on vegetable blues, &amp;c.; but how imperfect would be the description
which should fail to give us not only the elements of which each is
composed, but the nature of those substances which they form in
compositions?</p>

<p>We have room only for a single example to illustrate the truth of
our position. We select the mental power termed by Dr. Brown
“<em>anger</em>;” in phrenology, “Combativeness.” In his description of
this feeling, Dr. Brown is truly eloquent. His organ of Combativeness
must have been large, or he could not have described the feeling
with such vividness and accuracy.</p>

<p>“There is a principle in our mind,” says he, “which is to us like
a constant protector; which may slumber, indeed, but which slumbers
only at seasons when its vigilance would be useless; which awakes,
therefore, at the first appearance of unjust intentions, and which becomes
more watchful and more vigorous in proportion to the violence
of the attack which it has to dread. What should we think of the
providence of nature, if, when aggressions were made against the weak
and unarmed, at a distance from the aid of others, there were instantly
and uniformly, by the intervention of some wonder-working power,
to rush into the hand of the defenceless a sword or other weapon of
defence? And yet this would be but a feeble assistance, if compared
with that which we receive from those simple emotions which Heaven
has caused to rush, as it were, into our mind for repelling every
attack. What would be a sword in the trembling hand of the infirm,
of the aged—of him whose pusillanimous spirit shrinks at the very
appearance not of danger merely, but even of arms by the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
which danger might be averted, and to whom, consequently, the very
sword which he scarcely knew how to grasp would be an additional
cause of terror? The <em>instant anger</em> which arises, does more than
many such weapons. It gives the spirit which knows how to make
a weapon of every thing, or which itself without a weapon does what
even a thunderbolt would be powerless to do in the shuddering
grasp of a coward. When anger rises, fear is gone. There is no
coward, for all are brave.”—<cite>Brown’s Lects. Hedge’s ed.</cite> vol. ii. p. 32.</p>

<p>This is a correct description, as far as it goes, of the feeling or
emotion which may be termed <em>instant anger</em>, and which depends on
Combativeness. But he confines himself to the simple emotion as it
rises in view of provocation or insult, or any threatened injury. It is
true he speaks of resentment being “too long protracted,” (which
depends on Destructiveness, and this is another example of confounding
primitive elements of the mind with each other,) and <em>disproportionate
to the offence; transferred from the guilty to the innocent;
rising too soon</em>, when it <em>should be entirely suppressed</em>; and as <em>not
confined to the individual aggrieved</em>; but it is all in such a manner
as to show conclusively that he thinks the subject exhausted with a
description of what in common language is usually termed <em>anger</em>.
But phrenology teaches that the element of the mind, which is at the
foundation of anger, is “an active impulse exerting an influence on
the mental constitution, independent of unjust attacks.” Dr. Brown
has confined his description of the faculty to one mode of manifestation
or activity, which is precisely analogous to the case we have
supposed above from chemistry. But how imperfect is the description
till we are told that this elementary feeling is the basis not only
of <em>anger</em> or <em>resentment</em> at injury, but constitutes in every mind,
according to its strength, the propensity to oppose; that it aids the
good man to carry through his plans of benevolence, as well as the
bad to execute his purposes of malice; that united with deficient
intellect and weak moral sentiment, it makes the quarrelsome, vaunting
boxer, while in a different combination it is an important element
in the character of the unflinching philanthropist; that it not only
gives boldness to the soldier on the field of battle, and fills with indignation
the mind of an injured person, but imparts energy to the messenger
of peace, and even enables gentle and virtuous woman better
to fulfil the important duties of her station. We want to know what
is that element of mind which is the <em>basis of anger</em>, and then the
influence of this element in all its varieties of combination.</p>

<p>We are not aware that this representation is in the least open to the
charge of exaggeration. Nor is the defect of which we speak confined
to the system of Dr. Brown. It extends to all the systems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the old philosophers, and almost to every part of those systems; nor
could their principles of investigation and the data they had at command,
or which they would use, furnish any remedy. If they went
to the extent of their powers or their data, we should not complain;
and yet if there are additional helps or data, why should we not
employ them?</p>

<p>There is one more topic connected with this part of the subject
upon which we would remark, viz. the <em>nomenclature of phrenology</em>.
We cannot better introduce what we have to say, than by quoting the
language of Dr. Whately, published in the second number of this
Journal, page 47.</p>

<p>“I am convinced that, even if all connection of the brain with the
mind were regarded not merely as doubtful, but as a perfect chimera,
still the treatises of many phrenological writers, especially yours,”
(Mr. Combe’s,) “would be of great value, from their employing a
metaphysical nomenclature far more accurate, logical, and convenient,
than Locke, Stewart, and other writers of their schools.”</p>

<p>Higher authority on this subject than Dr. Whately could not be
cited. But the testimony of many persons of high authority might
be quoted. Even the opponents of phrenology will express their
admiration of its classification and nomenclature; and that, too, while
they profess entire unbelief in the truth of the system, not reflecting
that this excellency is an important argument in favour of its truth.
Simplicity and clearness are only attributes of <em>truth</em>; and the principle
is without exception, that of two systems, that which is most simple
and clear is most accordant with truth. Such ever has, and ever will
be, the verdict of mankind.</p>

<p>Without claiming perfection for phrenology in regard to <em>classification</em>
and <em>nomenclature</em>, we think its advantages in this respect to
mental science will be incalculable. Every writer on metaphysics
usually tills some scores of pages on the importance of being precise
in the use of language, and the danger of employing terms in a loose
and careless manner; and no one who looks at the history of metaphysical
science will consider such cautions as unnecessary. One
half or three fourths of the controversies which have taken place in
reference to the philosophy of the mind, have doubtless arisen from a
misunderstanding of <em>terms</em>. This is true not only in regard to subjects
purely metaphysical, but many controversial treatises on religious
doctrines would never have been inflicted on the world, had the parties
understood each other. We do not claim for a knowledge of phrenology
the quality of a sovereign universal remedy for those evils.
There are many subjects of controversy not directly connected with
the science; and difference of opinion as often arises from difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of feeling as from difference in intellectual apprehension. Even
phrenologists, equally well versed in the principles of their science,
will sometimes have different views. But with them, controversies
and discussions do not arise from a misunderstanding of language.
Although there is still <i lang="la">terra incognita</i> within the limits of the system,
and many indefinite points, some of which probably never will be
settled in our mortal state, yet the harmony of phrenologists on the
science of the mind is scarcely surpassed by that of other philosophers
on the science of matter; and even where only a partial
acquaintance with the science is possessed, such is the clearness of
its classification and the definitions of its terms, that misunderstanding
in relation to subjects legitimately involving such language is almost
necessarily excluded from minds of ordinary discipline and capacity.</p>

<p>We entirely accord with the opinion of Dr. Whately, that if the
science were regarded “as a perfect chimera,” still the “employing a
metaphysical nomenclature,” to which it has given rise, “would be
of great value.”</p>

<hr />

<h2>ARTICLE II.<br />
<span class="smaller">REMARKS UPON THE SCRIPTURE DOCTRINE OF REGENERATION.</span></h2>

<p>We have waited with some little impatience for some time past, to
see an article upon the philosophy of regeneration, based upon views
in harmony with Scripture and the phrenological philosophy of the
human mind. The third article in the first number of this Journal is
very correct, as far as it goes, but cannot be considered as taking up
the subject at the foundation. The truth is, the subject is one belonging
to the clerical profession, and to some able divine who is heartily
convinced of the truth of phrenology. To do justice to the subject,
in all its length and breadth, its height and its depth, will require the
hand of a master: and however well the work should be accomplished,
it would be certain to meet with opposition from the ignorance, prejudice,
and bigotry of some. This has doubtless been foreseen by those
best qualified to enter upon the task, and the public mind has been
left in the dark; and those who would seize a true mental philosophy
as a pearl of great price, have been frightened from going out after it,
because there was a “lion in their way.” But the subject cannot
long remain in this state; things are coming to a crisis; the public
will embrace phrenology, and trust to their own sagacity and comprehension
to reconcile it with religious truth. If phrenologists and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
divines neglect to settle where the boundary lines are in the disputed
territory, infidel trespassers will commit depredations. It is with a
view to call attention to the subject rather than with any expectation
of doing it justice, that we have resolved to prepare the present
article.</p>

<p>That our readers may be emboldened to approach the subject, we
beg of them to bear in mind that all truth, whether religious or
scientific, historical or prophetical—whether rational or miraculous—when
fully and rightly known and comprehended, must, from the
nature of things, and the character of the Great Author of all truth,
be consistent with itself.</p>

<p>Whenever, therefore, we see apparent inconsistency, we may rest
assured we do not fully understand the whole truth; and that the
reason is to be found either in our own ignorance, prejudice, or
incapacity. There are indeed many truths wholly beyond human
comprehension; and a miracle is nothing but a manifestation of
power by the Almighty upon principles perfectly consistent with all
his laws, but of which man, from his limited capacity, is unable to
see the consistency.</p>

<p>We would never stifle enquiry short of the utmost limit of human
capacity to pursue it; believing that when short and partial views of
truth give wrong impressions, it is better to enlarge and perfect the
view, so far as we are enabled to do, than to attempt to withdraw the
mind, and suppress enquiry. This we think is especially correct in
relation to all those truths which are so important to us, as are those
which explain our character, condition, and future destiny.</p>

<p>Man is the only being on the face of the earth capable of being
religious; or, in other words, he is the only being endowed with
faculties whose functions are in relation to religious truths and to
objects of religious worship. He is the only being whose faculties
enable him to conceive of and worship the Author of his own existence.
What a glorious distinction! and how little do most people
seem to realise it! And on this glorious truth what additional light
has been thrown by the discovery and analysis of the mental organs—by
the demonstration that man possesses organs more numerous and
of more exalted functions than belong to any other portion of his
animal creation!</p>

<p>The faculties thus peculiar to man, and more especially connected
with the religious character of man, are not, however, exclusively so.
<em>They have another range of functional relation and action.</em> These
two ranges of functional relation we will denominate, for the sake of
perspicuity, the one <em>religious</em> and the other <em>secular</em>. By way of
indulging in range of expression, and using language acceptable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
several classes of Christians, we may occasionally speak of the one
as sanctified or evangelical, and the other worldly or temporal. The
faculties which come under this class, are those termed by phrenologists
the higher sentiments. They are more particularly those
denominated Reverence, Hope, Marvellousness, Ideality, Benevolence,
and Conscientiousness. Some of these are more particularly connected
with the religious character than others. This is the case with
the three first named. They seem to be the earliest, deepest, and most
abundant fountains of religious feeling. The others fall into a course
of religious manifestation, and give consistency of life and practical
goodness to what would otherwise end in mere worship, faith, and
expectation. When the character is thoroughly and consistently
religious—when religious principle has become, like a piece of
leaven, operative until it has leavened the whole—then, indeed, all
the faculties may be said in some sort to manifest a religious function.
It is then that the propensities act in subordination to, and in harmony
with, the higher sentiments while those sentiments take a religious
direction. The higher sentiments may predominate over the propensities
in the ordinary life and conversation of the merely moral man.
Such a man may be honest, benevolent, respectable, and upright,
and have his propensities in subjection. He may not only be
punctual in attendance on divine worship, and unite in the services
with some degree of attention and feeling, but he may even erect the
domestic altar, and worship morning and evening, (because all this
may be true with an individual without a just charge of hypocrisy,)
and yet the individual may have no prevailing, predominating, or
<em>supreme</em> love to God. This is the case with many persons who have
been blessed with favourable organisations and education combined.
<em>But this is not that kind of control of the higher sentiments which
characterises the converted and thoroughly religious man.</em> A
thoroughly religious man does all things as in the presence of God,
and in obedience to his will; his thoughts are habitually upon divine
things. <em>We do not say of such an individual, that he has any more
or other faculties than the irreligious and profane individual.</em>
Were it so, a religious man would be either something more than a
man, or the irreligious would be something less. No, blessed be
God, the vilest wretch that lives has all the primitive faculties necessary
to enable him to feel and appreciate religious truth. We shall
show by and by that what is called the new principle, which takes
place, and which guides and animates the will of the religious man, is
not a new faculty.</p>

<p>We have now, as we trust, explained satisfactorily, according to
the phrenological philosophy of the mind, what the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
religious and the moral or irreligious is. The difference between
them is now very apparent. It is easily seen that this difference is
very great. It is not a difference of being, or existence, or entity.
It is not the difference between one that is active and one that is
inactive. They are both progressive; they both use the same
faculties. They are both travellers to eternity; but they go different
roads. They follow the direction of different leaders; they think and
talk of different subjects. They have different anticipations: one
looks to a guide, and moves forward in the broad effulgent light of
divine truth; the other endeavours to find his own way in the dark,
and relies upon his own unaided sagacity. One looks forward to the
end of the journey of life as the point whence open to his boundless
view the glories of another and brighter world; the other feels himself
at best but obliged to make a leap in the dark.</p>

<p>So recent is the science of phrenology, and so few are the religious
minds who have thoroughly examined it in all its bearings, and more
especially its religious bearings, that we feel constrained to detain our
readers to explain some few of the laws which govern the functional
activity of the faculties in general, and also to describe the functions
of several of the faculties of the religious sentiments.</p>

<p>1. It is a law of the manifestation of the faculties in general, that
the larger the organ the greater is its tendency to vigorous action
under excitement, and the greater its tendency to spontaneity.</p>

<p>2. When the organs of the so called religious sentiments are large,
other things being equal, they are most likely to manifest their peculiarly
religious function.</p>

<p>3. The objects of religion are so much more elevated and vast than
any of the objects of mere time and sense, that they give a much
more intense and powerful excitement and exercise to the faculties,
especially of persons of vigorous intellect and cultivated minds. The
low, groveling, sensual, and ignorant, do not so easily realise things of
a spiritual nature. Hence persons with large and active organs of
the higher sentiments, especially of Reverence, Marvellousness, Hope,
and Ideality, find no where but in religion full satisfaction to their
aspirations. They seem, as Dr. Spurzheim once remarked of such
an individual, “not made for this world.” The objects which
engross the minds of the world around them, appear “poor, stale,
and unprofitable.” They literally go through the world as pilgrims
and strangers. In such, the Christian character is incomplete; they
especially need benevolence to interest them in their fellow-mortals,
and to exert their energies in the glorious employment of doing
good.</p>

<p>Our attentive readers will at once anticipate the remark, that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
persons who are not converted, in whom the organs of the higher
sentiments are large, other things being equal, are more susceptible
of religious impressions than those who have small organs of the
higher sentiments and large propensities. Does not observation of
facts go to prove its truth? and is it not at least tacitly admitted by
many? Indeed, this great truth has been too little known and appreciated
by religious teachers, and especially in the selection of mission
stations. The organisations of the inhabitants of the Sandwich
Islands, and of some parts of Asia, are far more favourable to the
reception of Christianity than are those of many other portions of the
heathen world. But this is a subject to which we can only allude
now; at some future day we hope to give it a full consideration.</p>

<p>We will add, for the benefit of those who have not made themselves
acquainted with the leading principles of our science, that it is
by means of intellectual organs that the affective faculties are all
brought into relation with their objects. Hence they may be said to
be in a measure the causes of excitement to such of the affective
faculties, as are interested by the objects contemplated. The intellectual
organs may be spontaneously active, and conjure up scenes
which excite the feelings; or they may be acted upon by external
objects or by other minds. We may therefore bring our feelings into
a high state of excitement merely by the recollection of an exciting
scene.</p>

<p><em>Reverence.</em>—It is not easy to give a brief analysis of this sentiment.
We think, however, it is constituted to be excited to action by whatever
is perceived by intellect, or believed by Marvellousness to possess
the quality of greatness or superior power, whether physical, moral,
or intellectual. Many of the objects of respect in society are conventional.
The vast works of nature excite the feeling strongly; so also
do the majestic works of art, as shown in the temples erected to the
Most High. Who would not feel more reverence in going up to
worship in a vast temple than when seated in a hovel? None better
understood how to excite the feeling of reverence than the ancient
Egyptians. In them, as also in the ancient Jews, the organ must
have been exceedingly developed.</p>

<p>2. But when the mind contemplates the Deity in all his wonderful
attributes—the power which, with a word, could create a universe of
worlds, and by whose wisdom all things are governed, and whose
mercy, goodness, and justice, are past conception—how much greater
is the excitement to the feeling of reverence! How different, too, is
the emotion! It is more elevated, pure, and rapturous. When, too,
the mind brings to its contemplation the wonderful dealings of the
Almighty with his dependent erring creatures, as exhibited in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
providences, his plan of redemption, and the influence of the Holy
Spirit, our reverence scarcely knows bounds.</p>

<p><em>Marvellousness</em> next claims our attention. 1, The simple <em>secular</em>
function of this faculty is belief; the degree, kind, and conclusiveness
of the evidence, are no part of its function. We may believe on mere
authority. We may believe because it is rational, consistent, or
agreeable to experience. Without this sentiment, we should scarcely
believe the evidence of our senses, and perhaps we might say nothing
would appear to <em>be evident</em>. The every day occasions for the exercise
of this faculty are numerous. When large, it often becomes too
active, and is apt to render persons weakly credulous. It also leads
to believe in the wonderful, the spiritual, the improbable, the unnatural.
2, Its <em>religious</em> function is manifested in our belief in the existence
and attributes of God—his revelation to man; the Saviour and his
miracles—his resurrection and ascension; in the Holy Spirit and his
influence on the heart, &amp;c. How infinitely greater are these objects
of belief than those of a secular kind! Immortality is spread before
the eye of faith in brighter worlds above.</p>

<div class="verse">“The faith that unites to the Lamb,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><em>Hope</em> is constantly active in reference, first, to the <em>immediate</em> future.
We hope all things, and are carried along by this feeling through
dangers innumerable, until we at last drop into the grave. Had hope
no ken beyond the grave, all would be dreary; but secondly, this feeling,
in its <em>religious</em> function, brings to view a happy eternity, where
all is joy, peace, love, and praise. How different, and how much
more exciting, is the hope which dwells on eternity than that which
has reference to time!</p>

<p>We must remark here, that in the doctrines of phrenology there is
nothing which can be construed to aid or oppose the peculiarly sectarian
views of Christians. All those who disbelieve in the doctrine of
the Trinity, will not have the same views of regeneration as those
who believe in it. They will not believe in the agency of the Holy
Spirit; but they will believe in a change of heart from the use of
purely human means, and those will be governed by precisely the
same laws in both views of the subject. We will therefore attempt
to give what will be called the evangelical view of conversion, and
leave it for persons of different views to account for the <em>power</em> which
produces this change in their own way.</p>

<p>The first inquiry is this, What are the degrees of activity among
the faculties as governed by the ordinary laws of exercise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Thus some of the faculties, especially those termed religious,
are brought into a very great degree of <em>activity</em>. This arises from
the great extent and importance of the objects with which they are
brought into relation.</p>

<p>2. The propensities in general, and Self-esteem and Approbativeness
in particular, are deprived of their ordinary stimulus, and for a time
become in a measure paralysed; as self, and the objects which excite
the propensities, appear much diminished by contrast. To some,
the contrast appears so great that they feel humbled as in the dust.</p>

<p>3. By little and little the higher sentiments become accustomed to
this newly acquired higher degree of activity, and spontaneously
range in their newly acquired world of objects. Every thing is now
viewed as in the light of eternity. Man is now not only known, but
felt to be an immortal being with a soul of uncounted worth. There
is often a degree of exaltation of the feelings, and an increased mental
power, which greatly surprises those who knew them in their former
state. This appears in their deep insight into divine things, and in
their exalted devotional exercises.</p>

<p>4. As the religious sentiments become more and more evangelized,
or, in other words, as growth in grace progresses, they acquire an
habitual, an uncontested ascendency over the propensities, and take
the religious lead of their newly acquired masters.</p>

<p>In all this change, great, thorough, radical, and abiding as it really
is, we recognise only the operation of the same general laws which
characterise all great changes in mental character. The physical
organs are affected powerfully; and the emotions are only in exact
proportion to the felt importance of their objects. If exerted too
much at one time, or too frequently for the healthy endurance of the
cerebral organs, inflammation follows, and, with it, religious mania.</p>

<p>Next, inasmuch as different minds are very differently constituted,
so are they differently affected by the actual process of conversion to
a holy life. We shall be better understood, when we say that the
temperament, age, education, intellectual and affective faculties, &amp;c.,
all have an influence in relation to the manner in which their minds
will be brought to the realisation of religious truth, and to experience
its sanctifying efficacy. Hence it is of immense importance, that
those whose office it is to bring religious truth to bear upon the
minds of their fellow-men, should understand the peculiar nature of
the minds on which they are to exert their action. In short, they
should understand phrenology familiarly and practically, and should
apply it daily to their fellow-men. We will put one or two cases.
If, for instance, Conscientiousness be a strong faculty in an individual,
with Cautiousness also large, and at the same time he has gone on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
for many years in a careless worldly course of unbelief, the religious
teacher would be likely to bring vividly to his mind that searching
attribute of the Almighty, viz. his justice, which cannot look upon sin
but with abhorrence. He would point out the purity of heaven, and
contrast it with the impurity of a world lying in wretchedness, and
depict the nature, desert, and awfulness of sin, &amp;c. &amp;c. In this way
he would probably excite remorse and apprehension. But if the
individual have respectable reasoning powers, he should be impressed
with the utter hopelessness of entering Heaven while remaining in
his sins. He cannot fail to see at once, that Heaven is no place for
him, until he becomes fit for its society. The importance of things
connected with religion, should be clearly set forth and contrasted
with the temporary, fleeting, unsatisfactory things of this world.</p>

<p>We may reasonably expect, that labours of this kind rendered discreetly,
prayerfully, and in faith, will be availing through the influences
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We would here remark, that we should never judge of the genuineness
of a conversion by any special, infallible process the individual
may have gone through. It may have been a slow, gradual process,
as would be likely to be the case of a naturally finely organised young
person, whose moral and religious education had been well conducted;
or it may be quiet or unobserved, as in an individual of a large organ
of Reverence, and the higher sentiments generally, but of a sluggish
temperament. It may have been violent, overwhelming, and attended
by a remarkable experience—as the seeing of visions, &amp;c.—if the
individual have been of an ardent temperament, and with large perceptive
organs and large Marvellousness.</p>

<p>Equally diverse will be the growth in grace of different individuals.
Some will be almost like ground by the way side, some like stony
places, some like good ground covered with thorns, and some still
like good ground. Aside from peculiarities of individual character,
external circumstances, whether favourable or otherwise, may exert a
very great degree of influence. They may be like the genial influences
of a summer’s sun after refreshing showers, or they may be as
the chills of the winter frost.</p>

<p>Equally diverse will be the ultimately formed Christian character
of different individuals. But all who are truly pious, will show some
indubitable signs of it in their subsequent life and character; “By
their <em>fruits</em> ye shall know them.” Whether they have the same
mind which was in Jesus in its general cast; whether they be changed
in the general spirit and temper of the mind; whether they have love
to, and faith in, Christ, meekness, benevolence, sincerity, tenderness,
simplicity of life, love to the brethren, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The means that are rendered effectual in regeneration by the agency
of the Holy Spirit are equally diverse. But your next enquiry is,
how do we know that the Holy Spirit has any agency in the conversion
of sinners? We answer, we only know by the Scriptures that He is
the agent. The point is not strictly susceptible of any other proof.
But this is certain, that the agency must be one beyond our own;
no one could convert himself. We know, too, that persons who
have resisted all the influence of a pious education, cogent preaching,
example, the ordinary and extraordinary providences of God, &amp;c.,
have, when alone, and without any apparent external influence, been
suddenly brought to feel the great power and efficacy of religion.
All must therefore acknowledge the influence to be mysterious. It
would indeed be difficult, as we believe, to account for revivals
wholly from natural causes. Still, however, this point rests upon
Scripture; <em>and phrenology certainly contributes nothing to render
the Scripture doctrine less easy of belief</em>.</p>

<p>It is proper to notice here, that when conversions appear mysterious,
or when sudden and in advanced life, they are almost miraculous. It
is not the <em>ordinary</em> method, in which the mind is prepared for the
hearty reception of divine truth. The <em>new principle</em> introduced into
the mind is, as we before said, no new <em>faculty</em>. The expression is
at best obscure, and calculated to produce erroneous impressions. In
one of our beautiful hymns it is thus expressed—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But when the Holy Ghost imparts</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A knowledge of a Saviour’s love,</div>
<div class="verse">Our wand’ring, weary, restless hearts</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Are then renewed no more to rove.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now a <em>new principle</em> takes place,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which guides and animates the will,</div>
<div class="verse">This love,—another name for grace,—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Constrains to good, and bars from ill.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the <em>new principle</em>, which is otherwise expressed as love to
God, is no other than this. The higher sentiments are excited into
predominating activity, and led to contemplate with love and gratitude
the government of God and the wonderful love, revealed in the great
work of redemption of fallen men, a work in which he now feels
himself especially interested. It is a change of the <em>balance</em> and
<em>direction</em> of the faculties. They have seized hold of new things,
which are now regarded as all important; but before they were looked
upon with indifference. In relation to the mental faculties, it is not a
new principle, but a new <em>administration, produced by a change of
majority</em>. Hence the mental decisions are different. The actions
spring from different motives—from a prevailing love to God, and
obedience to his will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>In thus far speaking of conversion, we have shown what the Holy
Spirit does not do, rather than what He does. We have done this to
narrow down the field of mystery to its due limits, and to impress
our readers with the necessity and importance of understanding and
applying the true principles of mind in relation to religious action, as
well as to education and self-culture. Having done this, we believe
we have gone the full extent to which reason can go. We must look
to revelation, and that alone, for whatever further light is obtained on
this subject. In doing so, we are confident the reader will find
nothing inconsistent with our views. What is not explained in revelation
is known only to the Almighty, and is therefore a mystery past
finding out.</p>

<p>The great laws which regulate the growth, exercise, and rest of
the organs, and the force of the principle of habit or repetition, all go
to show the following propositions to be eminently true and of
immense importance.</p>

<p>1. That it is unphrenological, as well as unsafe and presumptuous,
to allow children to grow up without early, constant, and judicious
religious instruction and example. Where these are neglected, a
sudden change may come over the person late in life; but this is
hardly to be expected. How much better to commence and continue
in the right course, than to go on wrong for years, trusting to a
miracle to set us right. When to do so, we must turn quite round,
and, as it were, to go back and begin anew!</p>

<p>2. That religion does not consist in belief merely, and that the
work of grace requires long training of the faculties to give them
strength, stability, habit, and harmonious action, so that the person
will be constantly in the easy, delightful exercise of the Christian
graces. One of this cast and <em>training</em>, where organisation favours its
strong and healthy development, will show by his life and conversation
that his religion not only sets well upon him, but is a part of
him and pervades him throughout. It will beam forth upon his
countenance, his gestures, his gait, his subdued, simple, and kind
manners. His habitual obedience as a dutiful child of his heavenly
Father, will show itself in his appointments, promises, and engagements.
“With the blessing of God,” “With divine permission,” &amp;c.
will habitually be his language. It will show itself in his crosses, his
self-denials, his labours of love, and by the ejaculation, “Thy will be
done,” &amp;c.; his moderation in relation to the objects of this world;
his longing after immortality; his devotional habits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When we commenced our article, we had intended to have cited
Scripture to show the harmony of all the above views with it; but we
feel confident that our views will so readily call to mind all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
passages of Scripture which harmonise with them, that it would be in
a measure unnecessary. Besides, we did not promise to attempt a
full view of the subject, but rather to embolden others to do so. We
should delight to see a small work, written on the subject. It would
be the <i lang="la">vade mecum</i> of all those who exert themselves in the cause of
religious education, and the dissemination of Christian truth.</p>

<h2>ARTICLE III.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON DUELLING.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the American Phrenological Journal.</i></p>

<p>Having examined the heads of several gentlemen, since I have been
in the southern states, who have fought <em class="smcap">duels</em>, I have been struck
with the fact, that most of them have <em>Combativeness moderately</em> developed,
<em>Cautiousness large</em>, and <em>Approbativeness very large</em>. This
has led me to reflect upon the principles in our nature which instigate
and keep up the practice of duelling.</p>

<p>Duelling is a pretended display of courage, personal prowess, or
bravery, in defence of one’s character and honour. But it strikes me
that, on phrenological principles, with such an organisation as I have
alluded to, a man can be neither truly <em>brave</em> nor <em>courageous</em>, natural
<em>fear</em> or actual <em>cowardice</em> being the more legitimate result of such a
conformation. Hence it would follow, if we are permitted to take
the cases alluded to as proper data from which to reason, that the
fighting of duels is <em>no test</em> of courage at all; but rather the result of
fear, or (as I shall hereafter show) they generally evince a want of
<em>moral</em> courage in those who engage in them; and this view, if I
mistake not, exactly corresponds with the popular notion upon this
subject. But suppose they <em>did</em> display courage; what then? What
is this boasted courage, of which we hear so much?</p>

<p>Courage may be divided into two kinds—<em>physical</em> and <em>moral</em>.
The former, when analysed, will be found to consist mainly in the
exercise of Combativeness; and this is one of the lower propensities,
common to man and brute. Of course, then, physical courage is a
low passion; and one that is often displayed in the bull-dog or game-cock
far more powerfully than in the most gallant knight that ever
shivered a lance, or the most renowned hero that ever waded to the
temple of fame through fields of carnage and blood. But moral
courage, which is made up of <em>Combativeness</em>, <em>Firmness</em>, <em>Self-esteem</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and the <em>higher sentiments</em>, and which enables us to go boldly forward
in our own integrity and strength, and on all occasions support the
<em>right</em>, and do whatever Conscientiousness, Benevolence, affection,
and the reasoning faculties dictate, is an exalted feeling—a noble sentiment—and
none can show too much of it; for, since it cannot be
exercised but in a worthy cause, it is incapable of being perverted or
abused.</p>

<p>The manifestation of physical courage is proper when exerted in
defence of our natural rights; but is very liable to be abused, and
when misdirected, instead of its being a virtue, it becomes one of the
worst of vices. Man is not the natural enemy of man; and we live
in a community which professes to be regulated by wholesome laws.
Therefore, when one man voluntarily turns this instrument of defence
against his fellow-man, or exercises it improperly upon a brute, he
tramples upon the laws, and is justly held amenable and punishable.
Such a manifestation of Combativeness or courage is a plain <em>perversion</em>
of a naturally good faculty, and becomes odious and sinful; and
such I cannot but conceive to be the <em>kind</em> of manifestation of this feeling
which generally takes place in duelling.</p>

<p>“But,” says the advocate of duelling, “must I submit, then, when
I am insulted, to be disgraced?” Certainly not, sir; but, in order to
preserve your character from infamy, you should be careful not to
employ means which, instead of rescuing it, actually adds to its
degradation; or, in other words, in order to preserve your <em>honour</em>, you
should not resort to means really <em>dishonourable</em>.</p>

<p>But with the view to appreciate the weight of this subject, I have
endeavoured to bring it home to myself, and consider what reply I
would make in case I should be <em>challenged</em>. In our country, where
we have no <em>Court of Honour</em>, (an institution, by the way, which I
think ought to be set up,) I would say to the challenger, “Sir, if you
think yourself injured or insulted beyond the redress of civil laws, I
am willing to submit the case to gentlemen of honourable standing,
and settle it according to their decision.” If he would not listen to
this proposal, but still insisted on fighting, I would say to him, “Sir,
neither my conscience nor my judgment will allow me to be so fool-hardy
as to throw my life away by meeting a man who seeks my
blood, nor will my humanity nor my moral feelings allow me to
imbrue my hands in the blood of a fellow-being.”</p>

<p>Should he then call me a coward, I would reply, “Sir, you show
<em>no proof</em> of it. I hold that fighting duels is more frequently an
evidence of a <em>want</em> of <em>moral</em> courage, than a proof of physical
courage. If, by my course, I display no proof of the <em>latter</em>, I certainly
do of the <em>former</em>, by thus braving public opinion on a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
which I consider wrong. But suppose you <em>did</em> thus prove my want
of physical courage, you only show that my <em>intellectual</em> and <em>moral
faculties</em> are stronger than my <em>brute propensities</em>; and is this a disgrace
to a rational being?” Let the advocates of this practice say
what they will in vindication of it, and attempt to justify it on the
ground of its expediency, necessity, &amp;c., the fact is, all their reasonings
upon the subject are shallow, sophistical, and disgraceful in a
civilised, or more especially Christian community.</p>

<p>The only proper grounds on which to meet the question, are its
<em>reasonableness</em> and its <em>justice</em>. Is it <em>rational</em>? is it right? In a
barbarous community, where <em>might</em> is held as the only grounds of
<em>right</em>, the doctrine might meet with favour; but among us, who
reject such a principle of action, and who profess to be governed by
established laws, it is evidently <em>irrational</em>; nay, a gross neglect of
duty in those who profess to administer our laws, to permit individuals
thus to set them at defiance, and under the excitement of
passion execute vengeance on each other. But, on the scope of right,
the question does not admit of debate. Not only do the principles of
our holy religion, in the broadest and most direct terms, condemn all
such practices as sinful, but every moral principle of our nature
revolts at them. True, were we to suppress the influence of our
moral sentiments, and exercise our reasoning faculties in connection
with our selfish propensities only, we might say, “injury for injury,”
“blow for blow;” but even then we could not say, “death for
insult,” for there is no comparison between the two. An insult is
limited in its consequence to time; death reaches to eternity. But
phrenology teaches us, that we have no right to settle a question of
this nature, without exercising our reasoning faculties in connection
with the moral sentiments; and I defy any one to prove that the
<em>latter</em> ever sanctioned duelling. Nothing can be clearer than that to
<em>decline</em> a challenge would be an act of <em>moral</em> courage, and as much
more <em>honourable</em> than to accept, as the moral feelings are above the
animal instincts. If, therefore, any one choose to differ with me in
opinion upon this point, he is welcome to do so, and I envy him not
his privilege, for I hold mine to be the legitimate conclusion of a
rational and moral view of the subject; ergo, the opposite conclusion
must spring from the predominance of the brute propensities acting in
concert with the intellect.</p>

<p>Again; I am aware that it will be urged, as the most specious
argument in favour of duelling, that, in this matter, we are bound to
respect <em>public opinion</em>. But it has been clearly shown, that public
opinion (or that part of it which still advocates this practice) is
unquestionably <em>wrong</em> on this subject; and in this enlightened age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
every honest man, and every brave man, is bound to <em>resist</em> public
opinion in all matters that interfere with humanity, justice, and moral
obligation, and thus set forth the noble example of <em>correcting</em> public
opinion. And more especially is it the prerogative of phrenology,
above all other sciences, (inasmuch as it enables us clearly to analyse
the passions and motives of men,) to wield its giant strength, against
those vices which neither civilisation nor Christianity has yet been
able to subdue.</p>

<p><em>Public opinion</em>, forsooth! And what is public opinion? What
but an evanescent and a capricious thing—a fickle dame, ever varying,
ever changing—that raises a man a hero and a demi-god to-day,
and tramples him in the dust as a base wretch and outcast to-morrow?
Look at the Protean aspects of public opinion in the different ages of
the world, and among the different nations of the earth. Look at
public opinion in the different epochs of the Roman empire, and of
the Grecian states. Behold its changes. Look at it under the
mighty Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Medean, and Persian
dynasties. Compare public opinion at the present day in China,
with that in the United States. Compare it among our rude Saxon
forefathers, with that which prevailed in the days of William the
Conqueror. And in English society, what mighty changes has it not
undergone since the days of Henry the Eighth. Look at the changes
produced on public opinion by a Solon, a Zoroaster, a Pythagoras, a
Homer, a Socrates, or a Plato; an Alexander, a Cæsar, or an Alfred.
See the tyrant bow its neck to the mild, but sublime influence of the
Gospel, wherever it has been introduced. See it bend again before
the influence of philosophy, science, and the arts, and, more especially,
before improvements in our political and civil codes. And are
we to be told, then, that, amid the full glare of light and knowledge
which beams upon us, we are passively and submissively to bow to
this capricious tyrant, and not dare to raise our voices against its
cruel and absurd edicts? No. Reason forbids it; morality forbids
it; Heaven forbids it. Let the light of science and morality, then,
clear the mist from our eyes; and let us go on to <em>refine</em> and <em>correct</em>
public opinion, until every vestige of barbarism and superstition are
expunged from our herald-roll. And what is duelling but a vestige
of barbarism that has too long formed a foul blot upon our national
escutcheon?</p>

<h2>ARTICLE IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><span class="smcapuc">REMARKS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE CEREBRAL ORGANS BY ADEQUATE EXERCISE OF THE MENTAL
FACULTIES.</span> By Andrew Combe, M. D.</span></h2>

<p class="center">(Continued from No. 6 of this Journal, page 191.)</p>

<p>The next enquiry, and one of not less moment, is to discover <em>why
the increase does not follow in every instance</em>? and what are the conditions
which favour it? Multitudes of the young, engaged in the
same mental exercise, manifest no proportionate increase of power or
organ; and yet, if the rule holds good in one instance, there must be
causes for every exception, and to these I shall now direct a few
remarks, but necessarily of a crude and imperfect kind.</p>

<p>The first impeding cause is one already alluded to. On looking
at the analogous instance of muscular increase from muscular action,
it will be granted at once that, in some constitutions, there is a much
greater susceptibility of change than in others. In the nervous
system, the same principle of the influence of the original type
undoubtedly holds good; and while some are easily susceptible of
mental impressions and cerebral improvement, others are the reverse.
Here, then, is one ground of difference of result.</p>

<p>Another fact in regard to muscular development is, that while it is
favoured by due exercise, it is prevented alike by insufficient and by
excessive action, and that <em>what constitutes due exercise to one, may
be insufficient for another, and excessive for a third</em>. From this
follows the acknowledged axiom—That exercise ought to be adapted
in kind and degree to the individual constitution, otherwise it will fail
to increase either the muscles or the general strength. I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
shown that the same law applies to the brain and nervous
system, and that, if we act regardless of its existence, we inevitably
fail in successfully attaining our object. From ignorance of physiology,
however, on the part of teachers and parents, and ignorance
of the connection subsisting between the brain and the mind, this law
has been utterly neglected in practice. In our larger schools, accordingly,
we have from one hundred to one hundred and fifty boys in
each class, or from five hundred to six hundred in all, subjected to
precisely the same amount of work, and to the same general management,
in so far as the period of confinement and mental activity are
concerned; and the individual powers and wants of each constitution
are as little consulted, as if the whole were cast of the same material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and the same mould—and the result is what we behold and lament.
In some, the degree of mental exercise is adapted to their capability,
and they improve; in others, it falls much short, and their powers
languish from inaction; while in a third portion it goes as far beyond
the limit, and their minds and organs are worn out and impaired.</p>

<p>Healthy vigour is another essential to healthy growth, whether of
the brain or of the body; but, from general ignorance of physiology,
this has been, and still is, equally disregarded in the treatment of the
young. In our public schools, the whole pupils of a large class are
set to the same task, and undergo precisely the same confinement and
absence of wholesome bodily action. It matters not whether they be
robust or weak, indolent or vivacious, fond of play or fond of books.
It never occurs to us that what may be sport to one is a heavy burden
to another; and that the length of confinement, and absence of food,
which a robust boy can withstand, may seriously injure one of a
weaker constitution. It is needless to add, that nothing can be less
in accordance with the dictates of a sound physiology than the ordinary
arrangements of our schools; and, judging from the very inadequate
results with which so much labour is repaid, and the very
indifferent health which attends it, it may be inferred, that no discipline
can be less in accordance with the laws of nature, or less available
as a means of improving the minds and brains of those who are
subjected to it. The young, on account of their growing and rapid
nutrition, stand doubly in need of a pure and bracing air, and of
ample muscular exercise out of doors; and yet, so entirely is this
condition disregarded in our plans of education, that in the winter the
whole day is spent in the close and corrupted atmosphere of the
school, and the exercise is restricted to little more than walking to
and from it. It is in vain to think that the brain is not injured in its
development, and the mind not weakened in its powers, by this
neglect. The brain partakes in the general qualities of the constitution.
If the body be imperfectly nourished and supported, the brain
is weakened in common with the rest of the system, and the mind is
retarded in its progress, and often impaired in vigour, by otherwise
inadequate causes.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which tends in youth to impede the vigorous
growth of the brain and impair its action, and which owes its existence
equally to ignorance of the laws of physiology, is error in diet.
No fact can be more certain, or, indeed, is more generally admitted,
than that the young require wholesome nourishing food, in larger
quantities and at shorter intervals than when arrived at maturity.
Accordingly, undue abstinence is admitted to be very hurtful in early
life. And yet, notwithstanding the abstract acknowledgment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
fact, the practice of society is diametrically opposed to it, to the
manifold injury of the young. The proper interval which ought to
separate breakfast from dinner, because that at which vigorous appetite
usually returns in healthy and active young people, is from four
to five hours.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Beyond that time, waste goes on without any compensating
supply, and exhaustion consequently follows, attended by
weariness and a deteriorated state even of the digestive organs. So
far are we, however, from conforming to the indications of nature in
this respect, that the prevailing plan is, to make young people breakfast
early, say at eight o’clock, that they may go to school in time;
and, instead of giving them a good dinner, with an hour or two of
relaxation, about four or five hours later, their lessons are considered
more necessary than food, and while they are pushed on almost without
interruption, dinner is postponed till eight or nine hours after
breakfast, being at least three, and often five, hours after the time at
which it is wanted by nature.</p>

<p>From much observation I am persuaded, not only that the growth
and activity of the brain are impaired by this sad conduct, but that a
great deal of the delicacy and bad health of the rising generation, and
particularly a great deal of the increasing liability to dyspepsia which
pervades society, is owing to the same preposterous departure from
the laws of the Creator. It is no apology for the evil to say that it
cannot be helped—that there is so much to be learned that the whole
day must be given to it. When we become wiser, we shall discover
that it is easier and pleasanter to learn in accordance with, than in
opposition to, nature’s laws; and if we were once convinced of the
fact, there would be no difficulty in altering the practice. We all
admit that sleep is necessary, and that nature intended the night
for repose; and, consequently, neither parent nor teacher thinks of
setting his child to school in the night-time, however anxious he may
be for its progress. And, in like manner, let society once be convinced
that food at proper intervals is essential to the well-being of
the young, and both time and opportunity will be found for giving it.</p>

<p>Another cause of failure in invigorating a faculty, and increasing an
organ by its active exercise, seems to be an inadequate temperament.
What is excitement to the faculties and brain of a person of a quick
nervous or sanguine temperament, may prove utterly unexciting to
the faculties and brain of one with a low apathetic lymphatic temperament;
and, consequently, improvement in the faculty and organ may
follow in the former, while no change on either will occur in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
latter. The susceptibility will thus vary according to the nature of
the original constitution; and hence, in attempting to develope any
mental power, we can expect to be successful only when we are
certain that we have really the means of exciting and keeping up its
activity. A mere passing stimulus will not suffice to increase nutrition
and growth.</p>

<p>Perhaps, also, we sometimes fail from applying a wrong stimulant.
In seeking to improve a faculty, common sense dictates that it should
be exercised upon its most agreeable and perfect productions. Thus,
in cultivating a <em>taste for music</em>, we ought to present to the faculty the
most beautiful and harmonious music, because that is the best calculated
to excite it to agreeable and sustained activity. Accordingly,
such is the plan by which we cultivate the taste in communities.
But when we take an individual who has naturally no great liking for
music, but in whom it is desirable that the talent should be developed,
we do not stimulate the faculty to healthful exercise by daily accustoming
it to the perception and discrimination of fine sounds, but we
set him or her to labour for hours every day in producing sounds,
remarkable at first only for being so discordant and disagreeable as to
make every one keep as far from their source as possible; and thus
our aim is defeated, and the taste injured rather than improved. It is
true, that by stoical perseverance some arrive ultimately at the power
of producing sounds pleasing to their own ears; but it will be found
that it is only then that their musical faculty <em>begins</em> to be improved,
and that its activity is felt to be delightful. Many never arrive at that
point, and, after years of ineffectual labour, give up the attempt in
despair.</p>

<p>I do not mean by these remarks, that <em>playing on an instrument</em>
should be taught merely by listening to good music. Playing is a
mechanical exercise, calling other faculties into activity, and cannot
be acquired without practice. Besides, playing is not music, but
only the means by which it is produced; and, so far as regards the
music alone, the enjoyment is quite as great <em>whoever</em> produces it, as
if we ourselves did. Often, however, the mistake is committed of
thinking that we are using the most effectual means to develope a
taste for music, when we place the young person at an old piano to
rattle out discordant sounds for several hours a day; and we are
grieved and disappointed at the ultimate failure of an experiment
which, in the very nature of things, could not possibly succeed. By
assiduous practice on an instrument we exercise the <em>mechanical</em>
faculties, and may thus develope <em>their</em> organs to an increased extent.
But to produce the same effect on the faculty of Tune, we must
stimulate it to sustained activity, by daily accustoming it to the hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of exquisite music, and by guiding the judgment to the appreciation
of beauties. We may then hope to promote increased action and
growth in its organ.</p>

<p>I believe that in regard to some of the other faculties we commit a
similar mistake, and imagine that education fails to invigorate them
and develope their organs, when, in fact, our endeavours have been
wrongly directed, and could not be successful; but the present paper
has run already to so great a length, that I must postpone any farther
remarks on this part of the subject till another opportunity.</p>

<p>Before taking leave, however, I would again enforce the absolute
necessity of physiological knowledge for the successful guidance of
teachers and parents. If the size of the cerebral organs admits of
being increased by judicious exercise, and impaired or retarded by
mismanagement, it obviously becomes an indispensable qualification
for those who undertake their right direction to possess an accurate
acquaintance with the functions and laws of the animal economy; and
it is rather strange that we should have gone on to the present day
without such an obvious truth having been universally perceived and
acted upon.</p>

<p>Having now shown, 1st, That judicious mental exercise promotes
the development of the cerebral organs in youth; 2dly, That there is
strong presumptive evidence in proof of the same effect taking place
even in mature age; 3dly, That we are still little acquainted with
other important physiological conditions which act powerfully in
modifying the results of exercise; and 4thly, That the knowledge of
these conditions would greatly extend the efficacy of moral and intellectual
education, and multiply our means of advancing the moral
welfare and happiness of the race; I do not require to add another
word to induce phrenologists to collect additional evidence on all the
doubtful points, and to prosecute the enquiry with persevering accuracy,
and with a constant view to its important practical advantage.</p>

<span class="smaller">PHRENOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CHARACTER OF WILLIAM MILLER,
WHO WAS EXECUTED AT WILLIAMSPORT, PA., JULY 27TH, 1838, FOR
THE MURDER OF SOLOMON HOFFMAN.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>,—</p>

<p>Being in Williamsport, Pa., in the month of May, I was invited by
James Armstrong, Esq., prosecuting attorney of Lycoming County,
and Mr. Lloyd, high sheriff of said county, to examine the head of a
William Miller, who was then in prison awaiting his trial for the
murder of a German pedlar by the name of Hoffman. On entering
his cell, I found a good looking, not to say a handsome young man,
about twenty years of age, in irons, exhibiting no peculiar marks of
intelligence, yet a vacuity of expression, a mysterious, reserved
appearance, with a countenance somewhat downcast but rather sullen.
On proceeding with the examination, I found it one of the most painfully
interesting cases that had ever fallen under my observation. The
developments and their combinations struck me at once as extremely
unfavourable; and, upon this account, I took particular pains to obtain
precise and accurate admeasurements. They were taken in the presence
of the above named gentlemen, before the trial, and in the
absence of all knowledge concerning the prisoner’s <em>real</em> character,
except that he was charged with murder.</p>

<p>It is to <em>these measurements</em>, rather than to any statements of my
own, that I wish to call particular attention. They are as follows,
including the integuments. The allowance generally made for these,
is two-eighths of an inch; but, as his integuments were unusually
thick, three-eighths of an inch should be deducted in the present case.
This will give very accurately the measurements of the skull itself.</p>

<p>The <em>general</em> configuration of the head was not less interesting than
the particular developments. Whilst the heads of highly moral and
intellectual men generally measure from one and a half to three inches
more from Individuality to Philoprogenitiveness than from Destructiveness
to Destructiveness, <em>his</em> head was nearly round. The coronal
region was poorly developed. The sides of the head were bulged
out to an extraordinary extent, whilst it was flattened behind,
evidently indicating deficient social feelings. The cerebral fibres
were very short from the ear to the organs in the anterior lobe of the
brain, as well as from the ear to Adhesiveness and Philoprogenitiveness.
His head was somewhat above the average size. His body
was strong and well built, yet the quality of his organisation was
rather gross. His temperament was principally lymphatic bilious,
with some of the sanguine, but scarcely any traces of the nervous.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Such a temperament is much more favourable to the exercise of
physical than mental power, and to the manifestations of the animal
propensities than of the moral sentiments and the intellectual faculties.</p>

<p>Having observed the organisation of the body, and of the <em>general</em>
form of the head, I commenced a minute comparison of the relative
size of the respective organs. The result is as follows:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Amativeness, full.</li>
<li>Philoprogenitiveness, average.</li>
<li>Adhesiveness, moderate.</li>

</ul>

<p>I shall describe only the <em>extremes</em> of development, and the general
result of their respective combinations in activity. The organs
located in the sides of the head were the first to arrest my attention.
It was the development, not of any <em>one</em> of these organs (selfish propensities),
but the immense size of the <em>whole</em> of them, acting without
the restraints of either the intellect or the moral sentiments, which
would constitute the leading features of character. Acquisitiveness,
Secretiveness, Destructiveness, Self-esteem, and Firmness, were all
“very large;” Combativeness and Cautiousness were “large,” with
Benevolence, Ideality, and Adhesiveness, “moderate.” Any well
informed phrenologist can easily predicate the effects resulting from
such combination.</p>

<p>His predominating Acquisitiveness and Self-esteem would render
him <em>supremely</em> selfish, and incline him (Conscientiousness being
deficient) to appropriate things to himself, without regard to the
principles of justice or the right of others. His Secretiveness,
Destructiveness, Firmness, and Combativeness, with average intellect,
would enable him to devise and execute plans with tolerable
success for gratifying his selfish feelings. Still he had not sufficient
Causality to plan on a large scale, nor to adapt means to ends successfully
in the long run. He would deal principally in “little things.”
Conscientiousness and Benevolence would but feebly remonstrate
against any measures, however unjust or cruel, which his other
faculties might devise and carry into effect. Having weak Adhesiveness
and Benevolence, and very large Secretiveness, he would be
unsocial, almost destitute of friendship, spend most of his time <em>by
himself</em>, would have few intimates, and no confidants among his
acquaintances or even relatives. Few persons would know any
thing concerning him; a mystery would hang over all his affairs and
conduct.</p>

<p>His “very large” Secretiveness and Acquisitiveness doubtless held
predominant sway in his character. These, unrestrained, would lay
claim to, and appropriate to himself, that which did not belong to him,
by fraud, deception, stealth, cheating, pilfering, &amp;c. And Destructiveness
“very large” would add to these, robbery and even murder.
Having little sympathy or affection, with this organisation, I should
not be surprised to learn that even his relatives and friends had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
fallen victims to his predominating Acquisitiveness and Destructiveness.</p>

<p>There is one faculty in particular which must have entered very
largely into the composition of his character—viz. Secretiveness.
He was doubtless very sly, artful, and full of plots and stratagems.
While he would be cunning, and make few, if any, confessions or
acknowledgments, still he did not possess great fore-thought or penetration.
But in the art of dissembling, and making false pretensions,
he must have been a perfect adept.</p>

<p>Having “moderate” Approbativeness and “small” Conscientiousness,
he would have little regard for his character, or for what was
thought and said of him, and experience but little shame or remorse.
His “very large” Firmness would render him persevering in deception
and crime—would carry him through any difficulties, and render
him obstinate, wilful, and blindly set upon gratifying his selfish propensities.
This organisation would render him vindictive in the
highest degree, and whatever he might do or say, he would always
<em>justify himself</em>. Another striking fact was the “small” development
of Ideality. I have long observed that this organ was almost invariably
small in criminals, and its marked deficiency in the present
instance struck me with peculiar force. Numerous facts have led
me to believe, that a proper development and exercise of Ideality is
about as favourable to virtue and morality as even the influence of
Conscientiousness. By refining the feelings, it begets a disgust for
vice, because it is loathsome, and thereby promotes virtue. The
organs of the intellect were not remarkable for either their size or
deficiency. But in their exercise, they would be controlled principally
by the selfish feelings.</p>

<p>During the examination, allusion was made to the fact, (which he
had frequently related before,) that the day previous to the murder he
had become very angry, in consequence of meeting with some accident
in his mechanical labours, and broke in pieces the object of his resentment.
I afterwards was informed, that he was often subject to turns
of anger, and that he conducted strangely at such times—that he
would neither work, talk, nor eat, but either sit or lie down in silence
and sullenness for hours. In view of these facts, the prisoner’s
counsel attempted to account for the murder by pleading at the trial
partial insanity, but were unsuccessful. I was partly of the opinion,
that Destructiveness was morbidly excited prior to the murder. But
subsequent facts induced me to change it.</p>

<p>I have thus stated the impressions made upon my mind during the
examination, and deduced a few leading features of character, on
strictly phrenological principles, without any knowledge of the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
character or private history of William Miller, aside from a few
immediate facts connected with the murder of Hoffman.</p>

<p>On the reception of the above letter, wishing to learn farther particulars,
we addressed a line to the Hon. Ellis Lewis, presiding judge
of the court at the trial of William Miller, to which we received the
following reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the American Phrenological Journal.</i></p>

<p class="right">Williamsport, December 29th, 1838.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir,—</p>

<p>Absence from home on public duties has prevented, until this time,
an answer to yours of the 1st ult., requesting particulars respecting
the trial and execution of <span class="smcap">William Miller</span>. I do not know that any
paper contains these particulars, and I will therefore endeavour to
comply with your request by the following brief statement.</p>

<p>William Miller was indicted for the murder of Solomon Hoffman,
an offence committed in Jackson township, in this county (Lycoming),
on the first day of February, 1838. On the first day of May, 1838,
a jury was sworn to try the cause. The first count charged the
offence in the usual manner. The second count set forth that the
crime was committed “by lying in wait in, upon, and near a public
highway.” The evidence on the part of the commonwealth fully
established the facts following:—That Solomon Hoffman was a
traveling pedlar, carrying a pack on his back; that he sojourned one
night at Bastian’s tavern, situate at the edge of the woods between the
Block-House settlement and Pont Run; that William Miller was a
cabinet-maker, boarding at the same house; that these two individuals
slept in the same room together that night; that Miller, on being
urged by Hoffman in the morning to purchase goods, declined, stating
that he had borrowed money from Bastians, and did not wish them to
know that he had money, but proposed to purchase of Hoffman, <em>if
the latter would stop at the side of the road, in the woods</em>, where
Miller stated that <em>he</em> would be engaged cutting wood, as the other
passed along on his way. This was agreed to. Miller stationed
himself by the way side, with his axe, for the purpose of executing
his plan of destruction. The deceased soon made his appearance;
and while he was stooping down to take some articles out of the pack
to exhibit to Miller, the latter killed him with the axe. Having taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
such articles as he desired at the time, and all the money in the pocket
book of the deceased, Miller buried the dead body and the pack under
the leaves and snow, the latter being upwards of two feet deep in the
woods. The deceased was a stranger—a German—and had but one
relative, a brother, in this country. That brother he had engaged to
meet the next day after the murder in Bloomingrove; but as he did
not fulfil that appointment, the brother was alarmed, and made a most
anxious and scrutinising search for the deceased, but could find no
traces of him whatever after he left Bastians in the morning. The
brother then came to the public house of George Duitch, in Williamsport,
to proceed on his journey, giving up all hope of ascertaining the
cause of the mysterious disappearance of the deceased. By what
might be regarded as a singular intervention of Providence, Miller
<em>came</em> to <em>this tavern</em>, which was twenty or thirty miles from his residence,
<em>introduced himself</em> to the brother of the deceased, and, by his
<em>voluntary prevarications</em> and <em>falsehoods</em>, excited suspicion, which,
upon farther scrutiny, led to the full disclosure of his guilt.</p>

<p>The evidence was so full and satisfactory, that there was no room
to doubt with respect to the agency of the prisoner in causing the
death of Hoffman, in the manner already detailed. The counsel for
the prisoner, in their anxiety to do all in their power to save his life,
endeavoured to show that he was afflicted with that species of insanity
called <em>monomania</em>. But the evidence on this subject consisted chiefly
of the proof of <em>cases</em> where <em>other</em> individuals, whose minds appeared
sound upon subjects in general, were nevertheless deranged upon particular
subjects. The proof did not establish the fact that the <em>prisoner</em>
was afflicted with that species of insanity.</p>

<p>In the course of the trial, the prisoner’s counsel, <em>without objection
on the part of the commonwealth</em>, introduced Mr. O. S. Fowler, the
celebrated phrenologist, as a witness. He described the prisoner as
of the lymphatic temperament; and stated that persons of this temperament
are more apt to be deranged upon the animal passions than
upon the intellectual or moral faculties. He also, among other
things, described the prisoner’s phrenological developments, as they
appeared to him on an examination some days previously in the
prisoner’s cell. The organs of <em>Destructiveness</em>, <em>Secretiveness</em>, and
<em>Acquisitiveness</em>, were stated by Mr. Fowler to be immense, the head
measuring about 7¼ inches in diameter from ear to ear.</p>

<p>In giving the instructions to the jury, I stated to them that if the
evidence for the commonwealth was believed, it established a case of
murder of the first degree, unless they thought proper to acquit
entirely upon the ground of <em>insanity</em>. The species of insanity relied
upon by the prisoner’s counsel, was that denominated <em>monomania</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
This exists where there is a <em>delusion</em> on <em>one</em> or a <em>small number</em> of
subjects, which no course of reasoning or force of evidence can
remove. Every man, of mature age, is <em>presumed</em> to possess a sound
mind until the <em>contrary</em> appears. To establish this kind of insanity,
<em>delusion</em> must be shown to exist on one subject, or on some small
number of subjects. It was stated to the jury, that the court could
perceive no sufficient evidence of <em>delusion</em> or hallucination on any
subject to establish the existence of <em>monomania</em>; still, if the jury
believed that the prisoner was, at the time of committing the act
charged, “incapable of judging between right and wrong, and did not
know that he was committing an offence against the laws of God and
man,” it would be their duty to acquit; and if they did so, it would
be necessary to specify in their verdict the ground of acquittal, in
accordance with the act of assembly of 13th June, 1836. But (continued
the court) if any insanity exists in this case, it is of that description
denominated <em class="smcap">moral insanity</em>. This <em>arises from the existence
of some of the natural propensities in such violence, that it is
impossible not to yield to them</em>. It bears a striking resemblance to
<em>vice</em>, which is said to consist in “an undue excitement of the passions
and will, and in their irregular or crooked actions leading to crime.”
It is therefore to be received with the utmost scrutiny. It is not
<em>generally</em> admitted in legal tribunals as a species of insanity which
relieves from responsibility for crime, and it ought <em>never</em> to be
admitted as a defence until it is shown that these propensities exist in
such violence as to subjugate the intellect, control the will, and render
it impossible for the party to do otherwise than yield. <em>Where its
existence is thus fully established, this species of insanity, like every
other, relieves from accountability to human laws.</em> But this state of
mind is not to be presumed without evidence; nor does it usually
occur without some premonitory symptoms indicating its approach.
On this branch of the case the prisoner’s counsel have introduced the
testimony of Mr. O. S. Fowler, one of the most distinguished phrenologists
in the United States. The science of <em class="smcap">phrenology</em>, or rather
<em class="smcap">cranioscopy</em>, has not yet been brought to such a state of perfection
and certainty as to be received and relied upon in courts of justice.
Small deviations in the scull from its perfect form, not absolutely
denoting insanity, appear to be too uncertain to be relied upon in the
administration of justice, without endangering the rights of individuals
and the more important interests of the public. It is the opinion of
the court, that the testimony of Mr. Fowler proves no such development
of the animal propensities as would, of itself, justify the belief
of insanity in any of its forms.</p>

<p>The jury found the prisoner guilty of murder by lying in wait, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
set forth in the second count, and not guilty on the first count. The
verdict was delivered on the 4th of May, 1838, and, on the same day,
after overruling a motion in arrest of judgment, the court adjudged
that <em>the verdict on the second count</em> was a <em>finding of murder of the
first degree</em>, and pronounced the sentence of <em class="smcap">death</em>. On the 27th
of July, 1838, the prisoner was executed. He made a full confession.
Before and after the trial he was visited by clergymen, and appeared,
after the trial, much affected with his situation in reference to a future
world. Seemed truly penitent. Met death with great firmness, even
assisting the sheriff in some of the last sad offices of the melancholy
scene. His body was delivered to his parents for burial. They are
in low circumstances, but not in absolute poverty. They have never
shown as much attention to education as people generally do, and
their unhappy son was said to be exceedingly illiterate.</p>

<p>The above letters have been in our possession now for some
months, and we had intended ere this, to have presented them in the
pages of the Journal. But by this delay we have recently and very
opportunely received, by a gentleman from Williamsport, the dying
confession of William Miller. Whilst on the one hand we were surprised,
in its perusal, to observe the striking coincidences between Mr.
Fowler’s statements and the individual’s own confession of his private
history, on the other we were shocked to read such a long series of
youthful vice and crime. We doubt whether a similar instance can
be found recorded in the annals of history. The facts in the case of
this unfortunate young man involves many important principles in
jurisprudence, education, morals, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but our present object is
simply to present the <em>facts</em> in the case.</p>

<p>The general facts connected with the murder are contained in the
letter of Judge Lewis. But as his confession relates the particulars
more in detail, preceded by a continued series of vicious and criminal
conduct for fifteen years, showing the gradual process by which he
became so hardened and cruel, we are induced to present the entire
confession, notwithstanding its length. It is undoubtedly similar in
some respects to that of many others much older than Miller, yet less
experienced in crime, who end their days in the prison or on the
gallows. Though young in years, he had emphatically grown old in
the school of vice. We earnestly request every reader to notice the
following facts in his melancholy narrative, which undoubtedly prepared
the way for the number and enormity of his crimes.</p>

<p><em>His mother died when he was quite young. He was subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
little, if any, parental restraint and government; received, comparatively,
no education, nor moral and religious instruction; early
gave way to his “evil passions;” was greatly encouraged by bad
associates; was not restrained by the ties of family affection, nor
influenced much by any relations to friends and acquaintances,
either in regard to his business or his character; first commenced
stealing little things, then lying; persevered constantly in such
offences for nearly fifteen years, till he finally committed robbery
and murder.</em> But it appears that he had planned several murders,
and even that of his <em>own</em> brother, before the execution of his last
fatal deed.</p>

<p>Let every reader observe, that Miller grew up with his intellectual
faculties <em>uneducated</em>, his moral sentiments <em>unenlightened</em>, his domestic
feelings <em>but little exercised</em>, and his selfish propensities and sentiments
<em>unrestrained</em>. We need not say, that these facts involve important
principles in the true physiology of the brain and the science of mind.</p>

<p>The facts in the confession should also be compared with the statements
of Mr. Fowler’s letter. It is due to state, that Mr. F. has
never seen this confession, nor the letter of Judge Lewis—that he
knows nothing of the contents of either, and there is no reason to
doubt his statement concerning his knowledge of Miller’s <em>real</em> character.
A phrenologist will readily perceive that, from the data first taken by
Mr. F., even a darker portrait might have been drawn on strict scientific
principles, than what Mr. F.’s letter presents. We have italicised
some parts of the confession which strikingly accord with the phrenological
descriptions.</p>

<em>sanguine</em> and <em>lymphatic</em>, that of the organs located in the basilar and posterior
region of the brain. I have never found, within the walls of a prison, a purely

<h3>THE CONFESSION OF WILLIAM MILLER,<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Who was convicted of the murder of Solomon Hoffman, and executed
at Williamsport, Lycoming county, Penn., on the 27th of July, 1838;
made in the presence of the sheriff and attending ministers, June 7,
1838.</i></span></h3>

<p>I was born in York county, in the state of Pennsylvania, A. D. 1815.
My mother died when I was eleven years of age. My <em>natural disposition</em>,
from my <em>earliest infancy, was grossly depraved. I seemed fatally
bent on mischief</em>, and had a <em>relish</em> for <em>dark and secret crime</em>; and never
having received any religious education or instruction, (except from
occasionally hearing the gospel preached,) my <em>evil passions</em> and <em>malice</em>
of my nature grew with my growth, and strengthened with my years.
Before my imprisonment, I had not learned any principles of religion or
precepts of morality, by which I could discover the full deformity of my
character, or the deep wickedness of my conduct. The after survey of
my acts and conduct, and the <em>review of my crimes, were scarcely ever
attended, with a feeling of regret. I seemed too spell bound, in my evil
to relent</em>; and <em>my conduct so accorded with my evil passions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
reflection was without remorse.</em> I was greatly addicted to <em>theft</em>. But I
stole not through want so much as through the <em>gratification of my
wicked disposition</em>. <em>This disposition</em> was carried into action first when
I was <em>nine years</em> of age. I then stole an half dollar from my father,
and gave it to my mother. I told her I had found it. She believed me,
and bought a handkerchief for me with it.</p>

<p>Some time after the death of my mother, my father and family
removed from York county to Lycoming county, and resided in the
Block-house settlement. I lived with the family there till I attained the
age of nineteen years.</p>

<p>During my stay at the Block-house settlement, previously to learning
a trade, I <em>stole a pocket knife</em> while at a religious meeting, held at the
house of Mr. Knodle. I then became more bold, and having discovered
where Samuel Hartman kept his money, I <em>attempted to rob</em> him, by
breaking into his drawer; but in that I did not succeed. Soon after
this, I was living a short time in the family of Mrs. Bastian, who then,
and always, treated me with great kindness. I <em>stole</em> from her twenty-five
cents.</p>

<p>I next went to the borough of York, for the purpose of acquiring a
trade, and became an apprentice to Joseph Spangler, a cabinet maker of
that place, with whom I continued two years. At York I fell into very
bad company. I found there were others in the world, nearly, if not
quite as bad as myself; and wickedness is greatly encouraged with
countenance and company. <em>We were frequently engaged in robbing
orchards, stealing apples, peaches</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The first winter I lived at York, I <em>stole</em> between four and five dollars
from Mr. Spangler. I took it out of a small chest I found in his bed
room. One of my shop-mates was blamed for it, but I now declare him
innocent of the crime.</p>

<p>I <em>frequently stole segars and tobacco</em> from the store of George Small,
in York, and gave them to my associates, who had previously requested
me to do so.</p>

<p>After my apprenticeship was ended, I was employed as cabinet maker
for a short time, by John Beck, in York. I <em>stole</em> from him, at different
times, such articles as I needed to finish some furniture I was making
for myself, such as paints, varnish, &amp;c. I was strongly suspected for
this; <em>but I lied them out of it</em>, and contended most strenuously that I
had <em>bought</em> all the articles I used.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, I lived a short time with Jacob Lehr, in Freystown,
near York. While there, a harvest frolic was held at Mrs. Smithmoyer’s.
I knew that all of Daniel Louck’s family would be at the
frolic; consequently, I went to his house, broke in through one of the
windows, opened a desk with a key of my own, and <em>took out a pocket
book</em>, as I then supposed, full of money. I then left the house as I entered
it; and on my way home through the fields, I examined the pocket book,
and found that it contained nothing but papers which I could not read.
I threw the pocket book and papers into some bushes that grew in a field
belonging to Mr. Diehl. All the money I got on that occasion was about
one dollar and fifty cents in silver. I never heard that I was suspected
of this theft.</p>

<p>About the same time of the above occurrence, I was working in harvest
at Mr. Diehl’s, and I then <em>stole two five dollar bank notes</em>, which I saw
lying on the porch of their house; I was never suspected for this, and
never heard any enquiry made about it.</p>

<p>Shortly after this happened, I went again to Daniel Louck’s, and found
that all the family were from home except three of the women. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
staying a short time, I lay down in the hall of the house, as it were, for
the purpose of resting. After lying a short time, I discovered that the
ladies had all gone out to take a walk in the garden. I then arose, and
went to the same desk I had opened before. I also applied the key I had
formerly used, opened the desk, and <em>took out a pocket book containing
fifty dollars in bank notes</em>. Even this created no suspicion against me,
that I know of. I also frequented the house of Mrs. Smithmoyer, in
that neighbourhood, and <em>stole from her cakes, confectionaries</em>, and occasionally
some <em>small sums of money</em>.</p>

<p>I returned in 183- to the Block-house settlement; <em>my evil propensities</em>
increasing by former successful indulgence, and by being able to avoid
suspicion, I commenced the cabinet making business for myself, at the
house of Mrs. Bastian, with whom I had lived a short time before I went
to York to acquire a trade. Mrs. Bastian’s residence is situated in the
northern part of Lycoming county, at the foot of Laurel Hill, on the post
road from Williamsport to Wellsborough. The country immediately
around is composed of high and broken mountains, covered with thick
and dark forests. The road often for great lengths without a house, and
not very frequently traveled—generally as lonely as the pathway of a
wilderness. I did not at first settle there for the purposes for which I
afterwards saw it possessed so many advantages. But it very soon
occurred to me, that I had chosen an excellent situation for <em>robbery</em>,
<em>theft</em>, and <em>murder</em>, <em>on which my mind was now fully bent</em>.</p>

<p>I re-commenced my unfortunate career at the Block-house, by <em>first
stealing</em> from Mrs. Bastian fifteen dollars, and frequently afterwards,
such sums as I needed, to the amount of about five dollars more. I had
the confidence of the family, and free access to every part of the house,
which greatly facilitated my thefts. I was not suspected of these crimes
until just before my last arrest, when some money was accidentally
found in my pocket which was identified as a part of the money that had
been taken. This induced them to suspect me strongly, but <em>I denied it
with great firmness and constancy to the last</em>.</p>

<p>Some time in the fall of 1837, a drover (whose name I do not know)
passing through the settlement, stopped for a short time at Mrs. Bastian’s
house. At first sight, I supposed him to have <em>a large amount of money,
and immediately determined to murder him</em>. For this purpose, before
he could have time to pursue his journey, I hastened to the woods with
an axe, and cut a large club, which I thought more suitable for the purpose,
it being longer and more easily handled than the axe, and yet sufficiently
large for the fatal execution. I then concealed myself close by
the road he would pass, and not far from the scene of my last dread
crime. I then waited, planning the manner of my attack. I expected
he would be riding slowly and listlessly along, that I could spring upon
him by surprise, knock him from his horse, and despatch him before he
could make resistance. The drover was a large man and had an excellent
horse. When I saw him coming, contrary to my expectation, he
was riding rapidly, and consequently I could not have a good opportunity
to aim a fatal blow. I then reflected that if I should miss him, or
wound him slightly, he would be too strong for me, and I should be
detected, and so I let him pass. But <em>I felt disappointed, and wished
very much to kill him</em>, and if I thought I could have succeeded, would
certainly have murdered him. I saw him afterwards pass through the
settlement again, but I made no further attempt upon his life.</p>

<p>Not long after the failure of my design against the drover, Michael
Knipe, a blacksmith, was traveling from the Block-house towards
Lycoming creek, and called at Mrs. Bastian’s. He had previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<em>incurred my ill-will</em>, and I felt some <em>revengeful feelings towards him</em>.
I learned also that he had <em>some money</em>. I then <em>determined to murder
him, with the double motive of wreaking my vengeance and getting his
money</em>. For this purpose I proposed accompanying him on his way.
We traveled amicably together until we came to the Six Mile Spring.
There <em>pretending</em> that I was tired, and needed a staff to walk with, I
went into the woods and cut a club, with which, at a proper place, I
intended to despatch my fellow-traveler. But as we traveled on, still
conversing amicably together, my murderous feelings began to subside a
little, and I became more irresolute, until having passed the most appropriate
places for so dark a deed, I finally gave over murdering him; and
so we traveled, as far as I went with him, without any thing actually
occurring to show that we were not the best friends.</p>

<p>The awful murder for which I am shortly to suffer the just penalty of
the law, occurred on Thursday, the first day of February, 1838. Solomon
Hoffman, a foot pedler, called at Mrs. Bastian’s the day previous to
the murder, on his way to Lycoming creek. At that time I was particularly
ill-tempered, on account of spoiling some furniture I was making.
My shop stood near Mrs. Bastian’s house. The same afternoon that
Hoffman arrived, I had occasion to go into the house, and saw him with
his pack open, offering his goods for sale to the family. He asked me if
I would buy any thing. I told him I could not. I then returned to my
shop, and continued to work till supper time. I took my supper in company
with Hoffman; and during supper it occurred to me <em>to rob him</em>, and
I resolved to do so the next day. After supper we conversed a while in
the bar-room, and then he accompanied me to my shop.</p>

<p>Hoffman continued at my shop for some time, and we conversed principally
about my trade; I told him I could make sales enough, but could
get no cash. He returned to the house again; I continued to work till
late, and then went to the house also. We then soon retired; Hoffman
and I slept in the same room. As I lay in bed, I thought of the difficulty
of highway robbery escaping detection, and came to the conclusion that
I had better attempt <em>to kill him</em>, although I had failed in two previous
attempts. I did not sleep well, thinking about it; <em>I felt no fear or horror
of the crime</em>, but I did not know how I could accomplish it. <em>I woke up
frequently during the night and thought on the subject, and my disposition
to murder him still grew stronger</em>, and in the morning I was fully
resolved, if I could get an opportunity at all, I would kill him. I got up
early in the morning, and Hoffman rose shortly after. I then got my
axe and whet it. He asked me what I would do with the axe. I told
him I was going to the woods to chop. He then asked me again if I
would not buy some goods from him. On asking me this question, a
plan instantly occurred to me of luring him into the woods and executing
my fell purpose. So I told him I would not buy any goods at Bastian’s
house, and gave him as a reason for not buying there, that I had borrowed
some money from Bastian’s, that I had not repaid, and therefore did not
wish them to know that I had any; but I told him, if it was not too cold
for him to come to me in the woods where I would be chopping, I would
buy from him there. Hoffman replied to this, that he would go on in
the stage that day. I answered he might if he pleased. He then
changed his determination, and he was only going to Blooming-grove,
and would walk and stop with me where I was chopping.</p>

<p>Upon his saying this, I designated where on the road he would find
me, and told him he could hear me chopping from that place, and so find
precisely where I was; and having said this, I went off immediately
towards the woods. After proceeding a short distance, I overtook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
William Folkerson, of the Block-house settlement, driving a sled. He
had started from Bastian’s a short time before I did. He asked me what
I was going to do. I told him I was going to cut back-logs. We had no
other conversation. This was the man whom I at first blamed with the
murder, but who, I now solemnly declare, as I shall answer to God, is
entirely innocent of it. And I sincerely hope he will forgive me for
making this most false and dreadful charge. After Mr. Folkerson passed
on, I went into the woods at the appointed place, and hunted round, but
could find no trees to suit me. I then went down into the road expecting
Hoffman. Then went back into the woods again, and found trees to
suit. I cut one down, and was going to the second, when Hoffman came
to me. He first addressed me, saying it is cold. I replied, tolerable.
He then placed his pack on the log I had cut, opened his goods and
handed them out. I walked up to him with my axe in my hand, and
placed it down by the stump of the tree. I then selected from his goods
a pair of gloves and a handkerchief, and told him I would take these.
Then I suddenly became a little irresolute, and had almost told him I
had no money; but in an instant <em>I again resolved</em> “<em>kill him I will</em>.”
He then stood bending down looking at his goods. I stood partly behind
him, and taking up the axe, gave him a hard blow with the pole on the
back part of the head. He fell dead on his side the first blow. <em>I stood
and looked at him for a moment, and then gave him three or four more
blows on the back and side of the head.</em></p>

<p>Then for a moment I looked up to heaven, and cried three times
tolerably loud, Lord Jesus! what have I done!! I then took up Hoffman,
and carried him a short distance and threw him behind a hemlock log.
I was not satisfied with this, and took him up again and carried him further,
and then removed him, and covered him in the place at which he
was found. I tried to bury him, but could not succeed well, the ground
was too hard. I intended, as soon as I could, to remove him from that
and bury him securely. On the same day I hid his pack, only taking
out a few articles for the present. I found on his person about one hundred
dollars in money, and some other small articles, which I took then.
The week after the murder, I went to Williamsport and bought some
goods from Mr. Updegraff, which I paid for, or nearly all, with Hoffman’s
money. I also, at the same time, bought some articles from Dr.
Power, and paid him in the same way, and at the same time <em>stole from
him one dollar in money, and several chisels of different kinds</em>. When
I returned, Bastians asked me where I got the goods. <em>I told them my
father had given me money, and I also had bought goods on trust. In
short, I stole and robbed every chance I could get, from my cradle to
the day of my imprisonment.</em></p>

<p>I wish now further to declare, that no false evidence was delivered
against me at my trial.</p>

<p>I am sincerely thankful to the officers of justice, ministers, and
counsel, for their uniform kindness to me.</p>

<p>I now pray the world to forgive me the many injuries I have done, as
I hope I will freely forgive all who have injured me.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">TAKEN JUNE 30, 1838.</span></h3>

<p>Before my emigration to York, when the family were all on the farm
together, at a certain time which I cannot now recollect, I was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
about fourteen years old, and for the <em>first time was tempted to murder</em>.
In the absence of my father, my brother Michael had the management
of his father’s affairs, and the government of us children given to him.
My brother was very strict with us and tried to make us do what was
right, and on failing to do so, he would chastise us, <em>which created a
hatred in my breast towards him, and I determined in my own mind to
destroy him. To carry out this determination, I gathered vegetable
poison from trees, mixed it in soup, and intended fully to give it to
him, and did so.</em> My brother saw something in his soup that did not
please him, took up his plate, went to the door, and threw it out, which
saved him. I do now sincerely pray Almighty God to forgive me, and I
humbly pray my brother to forgive me for attempting to make him suffer
so awful a death. After my return from York, while living at Bastian’s,
I went into the Block-house settlement on some business which I do not
now recollect; on my way home, after doing my business, I stopped a
while at John Howard’s barn, looking at some hands engaged in threshing
with a machine. There came a stranger riding by—<em>it immediately
occurred to me that I might follow and murder him, if he was not a
methodist preacher</em>. I did follow him, and cut a good club to put my
designs into execution. He took the new road, I took the old one, and
intended to overtake him at the place where the two roads met; but
when I came to the place where I expected to meet him, luckily for himself,
he got past before I reached the place, and I never saw him more.
The reason why I intended not to kill him if he was a preacher, was,
<em>that clergymen never have money, and are considered poor game</em>.
This was in the fall of the year.</p>

<p>After this, in the winter, I was in at Messrs. Benners’ store, in the
Block-house settlement, and introduced some conversation with respect
to some mahogany that I wanted to make some bureaus, and asked Elias
Benner when he expected to go to Philadelphia. He told me he could
not say to a certainty, but thought some time in the spring. I then asked
him if he would let me know when he did go, that I would go as far as
Williamsport, and there make arrangements with him to buy mahogany
and other materials I wanted. <em>This plan was laid by me to murder him
on the way, as I knew he would have money</em>; but, fortunately for himself,
ere the time arrived, I committed the awful deed for which I must soon
suffer, and the prison became my home, or he too might now be in
eternity.</p>

<p>Not long after this, <em>I had also intended to murder David Raker, for
this reason</em>; in a conversation with him at his house, he told me he was
<em>going to collect money</em>; he did go, called at my shop—we had some conversation,
which I do not now recollect; but while there, <em>I forgot this
determination, why or wherefore I cannot say, but sure I am it was no
goodness in me</em>. I also <em>stole</em> from Jacob Bastian, in the Block-house
settlement, screws and nails, as I had opportunity when at work there.
I also <em>intended robbing my brother Daniel’s chest</em> in Blooming-grove,
cannot say whether I did or did not. The last winter I worked at York,
<em>I intended robbing</em> Dr. Ness, went up stairs, rummaged his bureau, &amp;c.
but found no money.</p>

<p>I also <em>went to rob my cousin, Daniel Seib</em>, in York; he told me he
had $400 in his chest; I went to the chest, opened and searched for the
money, but found none, and was much disappointed.</p>

<p>I also <em>intended robbing</em> James Dinkle’s chest, but could not get it
open. James Dinkle is a mulatto, and then lived with Daniel Louck,
at Diehl’s mill, near York. About a month before I left my master, Mr.
Spangler, I <em>stole</em> from him a hammer and a two foot rule, which I brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to the Block-house with me. I also <em>robbed</em> my shop-mate, John Smith,
of about fifty cents, which he left in the garden house and forgot. Soon
as he came out I went in, found it, put it in my pocket. He missed it,
soon went back, and it was gone. Soon as he returned he charged me
with it; <em>I lied him out of it</em>; he then gave me clear, and blamed a black
boy belonging to Mr. Kelly.</p>

<p>The first harvest, whilst reaping for Jacob Kindig, on Mr. Longenecker’s
farm, in the evening <em>I stole</em> a sickle out of the field, whom it
belonged to I do not know. I also <em>stole</em> a board from Daniel Wiser, in

<p>We have just alighted upon a most curious and interesting document,
and propose to base upon it a phrenological article.</p>

<p>The late lamented Dr. Lovell, Surgeon General of the U. S. Army,
set himself about investigating the claims of phrenology in what seems
to us the only fair and philosophical manner, viz. taking measurement
of the heads of all persons of his acquaintance, particularly those who
were distinguished for any talent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Below is a paper drawn up by that gentleman and Dr. Brereton; a
document of incontestable genuineness, giving the measurement of
more than fifty distinguished individuals, among whom are Van
Buren, Webster, Calhoun, Clay, Marshall, M’Duffie, John Quincy
Adams, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We insert the document entire, sure that it will be examined with
care by all who are examining phrenology, and regarded with interest
by general readers, who can thus place head by head our great men.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the uninitiated, we will explain the principles of
these admeasurements, and then give the inferences to be drawn from
them.</p>

<p>The occipital spine is the lump or knob which every person may
feel on the back of his own head, just in the centre of the skull, a
little above the nape of the neck; lower Individuality is just between
the eyes, where the root of the nose springs from the forehead; this
measurement gives the whole length of the head. The average
length of men’s heads is seven inches five-tenths; the average length
of the fifty-two heads in this table, is seven inches seven-tenths, being
two-tenths of an inch more than common heads. Now, this may seem
at first a small matter, but two-tenths of an inch added to the length of
a man’s nose, would make a very different proboscis, and added to the
length of the fibre of his brain, might make him longer headed than
his neighbours in more than one sense of the word. But, <i lang="fr">n’importe</i>,
we are looking at the facts; the longest heads are those of Daniel
Webster, Langdon Cheeves, James Barbour, and Mr. M’Duffie, each
measuring eight inches two-tenths; or seven-tenths of an inch more
than the average measure of men’s heads.</p>

<p>Next come John M’Lean and William Wirt, measuring eight inches
one-tenth; then John C. Calhoun, Judge Marshall, Attorney General
Berrien, and Judge Baldwin, each eight inches; next come Henry
Clay, Samuel L. Southard, Judge Trimble, John Quincy Adams, and
Martin Van Buren. These are all longer headed men than the
average of the list; while Levi Woodbury is smaller by one-tenth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and the last postmaster, Barry, by two-tenths. The shortest head in
the list is that of Col. M’Kenney.</p>

<p>The next measurement is from the cochile, or hollow of the ear, to
the occipital spine on the bump felt in the back of the head. It is
asserted by some phrenologists, that this measurement gives the
development of Inhabitiveness, or in the vernacular, the disposition to
stay at home, attachment to place; but others, schismatics, say it
indicates Concentrativeness, or power of fixing and concentrating
thought. Be this as it may, among those on our list, John M’Lean
and Judge Baldwin are the longest in this direction; next Henry
Clay, Judge Johnson, &amp;c. The smallest, and very small, (the
average being in common men four inches two-tenths,) is Col.
M’Kenney, who, (Heaven help him) is tied to home by a fibre of
only three inches. No wonder he has trotted all over the world, and
received the appointment of U. S. Indian Agent.</p>

<p>The next line of the table gives the measurements from the ear
forward to Individuality, on the centre of the forehead between the
eyes. This measurement, when taken in relation to the other
measurements of each individual’s head, is much relied on by
phrenologists as a test of the strength of the perceptive faculties;
men who perceive and remember a multitude of individual facts and
things, should belong here.</p>

<p>The longest in the list are J. Q. Adams, Judge Baldwin, and Gen.
D. Parker. The average length of men’s heads in this direction, is
less than five inches; the above measure five inches three-tenths;
James Barbour, William Wirt, and Langdon Cheeves, each measure
five inches two-tenths; Judge M’Lean and Mr. M’Duffie measure
five inches one-tenth. Webster, Clay, and Calhoun, are a little
longer than the average; Van Buren falls considerably short of the
mark.</p>

<p>Col. M’Kenney should be well endowed in the perceptive faculties,
for although his fibre measures but four inches nine-tenths, we must
recollect that his head is small. The shortest in the list is R. Johnson.
Now, among all men we ever met, no one can match John Q.
Adams for minute and varied knowledge, save and except Lord
Brougham.</p>

<p>The next measurement is from the ear to the top of the head, where,
it is said, is the organ of Firmness; and the height of the head should
indicate the strength of this quality. And here we used to think we
had the phrenologists on the hip, judging from some of our own eye
measurements; but we were told it must be taken in relation with
other qualities; a man may be firm in vice’s cause as well as virtue’s,
but then he is called stubborn; or his firmness may be qualified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
caution or cowardice—he may be a confirmed coward, &amp;c. But no
matter, we proceed to the measurements. The average of Firmness
of these men, measured by Gunter’s scale, is five inches seven-tenths.
We find Judge M’Lean overtops them all, and has a mountain of
Firmness, measuring six inches three-tenths; next comes Mr.
Mitchell, of South Carolina, then Messrs. Webster and Cheeves—six
inches one-tenth; then lower, but yet high, John Quincy Adams,
Calhoun, Barbour, Johnson, M’Duffie, Baldwin, Barry. Van Buren’s
Firmness would never be in his way, being a tenth lower than the
average; Mr. Clay’s is three-tenths; and one person, Lt. Simonson,
is only five inches and two-tenths! The small Firmness, alias, small
obstinacy, of Clay, perhaps qualifies him so well for mediator—pacificator.</p>

<p>Now let us apply the rule and compass the other way, and look at
the measurements through the head; that is, from ear to ear, or rather
along the ear from Destructiveness to Destructiveness, which indicates,
also, the size of Secretiveness; it is said to be necessary to
statesmen, players, and thieves.</p>

<p>Men generally measure five inches six-tenths in this direction; but
the average measure of this list gives seven inches seven-tenths; from
whence phrenologists would infer, that our worthies destroy and
secrete only in the ratio of one-tenth more than the rest of the people;
a very charitable conclusion, truly! The longest is Dr. Todsen, of
the United States Army; who, <i lang="la">horribile dictu</i>! measures six inches
and six-tenths! No wonder he was afterwards cashiered for theft;
how could he help it, with such a bump! Next to this unfortunate
worthy—and, as if to mark the contrast, and note the folly of phrenological
predictions, comes—who? why, our present magnanimous and
open-hearted president, who was then (nine years ago) the innocent
and unsophisticated Martin Van Buren!</p>

<p>We feel almost indignant at the insinuation implied in this measurement;
not that we doubt its correctness, or the motives of Doctors
Lovell and Brereton, but they should have put in as a salvo the
measurement of our president’s Conscientiousness, which, we think,
must be enormous, in order to counterbalance this Secretiveness; for
we are confident that nine years ago he had no fixed plans and determinations
which he <em>secreted</em> from the world.</p>

<p>To be sure Judge Trimble is placed in the same category, and
following close after, comes Daniel Webster, whose Destructiveness,
measuring a tenth less than the president’s, is, nevertheless, enormously
developed, and probably is</p>

<p class="noindent">to the feathered and finny tribes which are so unfortunate as to frequent
his neighbourhood. He is rather apt also to attack and destroy the
arguments of his opponents. Barbour and Southard also are set down
as destructives to the extent of six inches and three-tenths; while
M’Lean, Marshall, Woodbury, and Baldwin, go the length of six
inches two-tenths; John Quincy Adams and Tazewell, six and one-tenth;
even Clay cannot be called a conservative, for he, with
Calhoun, M’Duffie, and others, go the length of three-tenths of an
inch more than the average of men in the destructive line.</p>

<p>The next measurement is from Cautiousness to Cautiousness; that
is, the breadth of the head about four fingers above the ears at the
broadest part. Some heads run up in a regular slope from above the
ears to the crown; of course there can be little of the organ of caution
there, and phrenologists maintain that this is the characteristic of
French skulls; while other heads bulge out above the ear, having
what they call large Cautiousness, and they point to the well-known
bulge in Hindoo skulls.</p>

<p>Cautiousness, however, we believe, is not now considered by
phrenologists to be merely a negative quality, as was taught by Gall,
but a positive one, and more like fear. When this organ is deficient,
the individual should be rash and precipitate; when full, cautious and
circumspect; when very large, irresolute and wavering. Too much
in a judge would be a failing, “which leans to virtue’s side;” too
much in a soldier would oftener prove his disgrace than his honour;
for one Fabius, who gained the name of Great, we have a thousand
Marcelli; the glitter of the sword dazzles the multitude, but the virtue
of the shield is known only to a few.</p>

<p>The first thing which strikes one on examining this part of the
table, is the great difference between the measurements of caution in
military men, and in the statesmen and judges; the latter are all
large—some of them very large—the former are small; the average
measurement of the judges and statesmen is six inches, while that of
the officers is but five inches and three-tenths!</p>

<p>For instance, Judge Marshall has the enormous measurement of
six inches and three-tenths in the organ of Cautiousness—that of the
average being only five inches seven-tenths; Judge Trimble and Mr.
Barbour measure 6-2; Messrs. Van Buren and Adams, Judges
M’Lean and Berrien, 6-1; Messrs. Clay, Calhoun, Webster, Tazewell,
&amp;c. six inches. On the other hand, Major Wade measures
only five inches; Lieut. Farley 5-1; Col. Towson 5-2; Col. Gibson,
Major Kearney, and Lieut. Graham, 5-3. Most of the rest are below
the average; and only two, General Parker and Col. Bomford, measure
over six inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>The last measurement we shall notice, is from Ideality to Ideality,
that is, through the head, just above and behind the temple. Phrenologists
suppose that this organ is essential to the poet, though it alone
will not make a poet; he must have, besides, Language, Time,
Tune, &amp;c. Ideality in the common man may show itself in his
good taste, in dress, furniture, &amp;c.; in the orator or writer, in his
tropes and figures; in all men, by the conception of, and aspiration
to, something finer, better, superior to what it actually is.</p>

<p>In our list, it is largest, and enormously large, in Charles Hill,
who was, we believe, an elegant dresser, quite a Corinthian; he
measures six inches five-tenths, the average being five inches seven-tenths;
Webster is 6-4 [Qy. 6-2?]; next Messrs. Barry, Parker,
Woodbury, Cheeves, Van Buren, Wirt, &amp;c., all of whom have it
large. On the other hand, Judges Berrien and Marshall, Adams,
Barbour, Southard, fall below the average; and Calhoun measures
only five inches one-tenth. The remarkable diminutiveness of this
organ, taken with the terseness of his language, which never shows
a trope or figure of any kind, is a “coincidence” at least.</p>

<p>The measurements of this paper correct some erroneous impressions
which the public generally have. We always supposed, for instance,
that the heads of Judge Marshall and Mr. Calhoun were unfavourable
to the phrenological doctrine, as being quite small; but it seems they
are actually large; and, though narrow, the region of Ideality capable
of containing a more than usual quantity of brain.</p>

<p>The largest head in the list is that of Daniel Webster, but it is not
most to our liking, for there is a goodly share in the animal region;
and though he has “most brains of the bunch,” they are not of the
very choicest kind.</p>

<p>Phrenologists, looking over these measurements, and without
regarding the names, would say that the best head was No. 7, belonging
to Judge M’Lean, because it is full in the upper or moral region;
Firmness, and its neighbouring Veneration, are large; they would call
it a well-balanced head, and conclude that its great intellectual power
would not be made a pander to the animal propensities. (We ourselves
should prefer it; but, lest we should be suspected of a political
bias in favour of the latter, we avow that our vote is for Daniel,
<i lang="fr">malgré</i>, his occiput.) The next heads, in the order of size, are
Judges Baldwin, Marshall, Trimble, and Johnson; Messrs. Cheeves,
M’Duffie, Wirt, Adams, (a quartetto of the same size); next, Clay,
Van Buren, Calhoun, and Southard.</p>

<p>We have stated that we are candid enquirers into the nature of
phrenology; we believe we are so; and if the facts shown in this
paper are favourable to its pretensions, the fault is not ours, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
nature’s; we admire and we adopt the motto of one of its lights,
“<i lang="la">res non verba quæso</i>.”</p>

<p>It would have been as easy for us to seek for, and to set forth,
opposing arguments and facts; and we should have done it in the
spirit of the motto just quoted; but as the vast majority of men of
learning, and almost all writers, are opposed to phrenology—as it is
assailed every day by argument and ridicule—as its opponents are
rather uproarious whenever it is seriously mentioned—we deem it but
fair <i lang="la">audire alteram partem</i>.</p>

<p>In plain truth, we are all, to a certain extent, phrenologists; and
the disciples of Gall and Spurzheim have no right to claim for their
masters the credit of originality, or for themselves the credit of
peculiar and new views of nature. No age, since Aristotle, has been
without its philosophers, who pointed out the brain as the organ by
which the mind carried on its operations; and it is now generally
admitted to be its primary and essential instrument.</p>

<p>A shrewd and practical English philosopher, and an uncompromising
anti-phrenologist, writes thus: “Mind, connected with body,
can only acquire knowledge slowly through the bodily organs of
sense, and more or less perfectly according as these organs and the
central brain are perfect. A human being, born blind and deaf, and
therefore remaining dumb, as in the noted case of the boy Mitchell,
grows up closely to resemble an automaton; and an originally misshapen
or deficient brain causes idiocy for life. Childhood, maturity,
dotage, which have such differences of bodily powers, have corresponding
differences of mental faculties; and as no two bodies, so no
two minds, in their external manifestations, are quite alike. Fever,
or a blow on the head, will change the most gifted individual into a
maniac, cause the lips of virgin innocence to utter the most revolting
obscenity, and those of pure religion to speak horrible blasphemy;
and most cases of madness and eccentricity can now be traced to a
peculiar state of the brain.”</p>

<p>What the nature and the powers of the human soul may be, we
know not, nor can we know, until it is disembodied and disenthralled;
until this mortal shall put on immortality, and time and
space shall be no more; then, doubtless, the power of ubiquity, and
a searching vision to which the diameter of the globe will present no
more of an obstacle than does the thinnest glass to the mortal eye,
will be among the least of the spiritual powers; but, until then, if we
would study the nature of the spirit, we must consider it as trammeled
by, and operating through, a corporeal organisation.</p>

<p>The difference between the vast majority of thinking men and
ultra-phrenologists, we believe to be narrowed down to this; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
admit that the spirit of man, manifesting itself through corporeal
organisation, is influenced and modified by, and indeed entirely
dependent upon, the nature and state of that organisation, particularly
of the brain and nervous system; while phrenologists go farther, and
say, that according to the length and breadth of certain bundles of
fibres in certain compartments of the brain does the spirit manifest its
different faculties with different degrees of activity and power.</p>

<p>We all of us admit, that even the giant mind of a Newton, or a
Napoleon, would struggle in vain against the finger of an infant pressing
upon the brain; but phrenologists maintain, that as the finger
should be pressed upon one or another organ, so would one or
another of the mental powers be immediately affected. Perhaps the
truth is beyond the extremes; and while we should strive to attain
the <i lang="fr">juste milieu</i>, we should not be deterred by any fears of what may
be the inferences from searching for truth in observations upon
nature.</p>

It is a valuable document, on account of the <em>facts</em> it contains respecting the size of
the heads of many of our distinguished men. These facts accord most strikingly
with a fundamental law in phrenology, viz. that “size, other things being equal,
is a measure of power.” We would, however, state that the conditions involved
in the phrase—“other things being equal”—are of the greatest importance, and
should always be taken into the account, in judging of character on phrenological
principles. The above article is spiced in several places with considerable humour
and pleasantry, exhibiting a very fair, if not a large, organ of “Mirthfulness” in
the writer. We would simply remark, that the article was prepared for the magazine

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>

<p><i>Mr. Combe’s Second Course of Lectures.</i>—In our last number, we
gave a particular account of the reception of Mr. Combe’s first course of
lectures in this city. The second course (then in a state of progress)
was completed on the evening of April 6th, at the Musical Fund Hall.
A very large audience was in attendance. After the close of the lecture,
and Mr. Combe had retired, on motion, Dr. Wylie, professor of ancient
languages in the University of Pennsylvania, was called to the chair,
and Dr. M’Clellan, professor of surgery in the Jefferson Medical College
of this city, was appointed secretary.</p>

<p>The chairman addressed the audience in a few brief remarks upon the
propriety of making some expression of the satisfaction which the very
numerous class had derived from Mr. Combe’s lectures. On motion,
the following resolutions, offered by Thomas Fisher, Esq., were unanimously
adopted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That this class have listened with great interest to the
able and highly instructive exposition of phrenology which Mr. Combe
has offered us.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That whatever may have been our previous acquaintance
with the subject, the lectures of Mr. Combe have impressed us with
much respect for its practical importance, and with the kindliest feeling
for the learned lecturer.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That phrenology is recognised and commended as a
science founded in nature, by a large portion of the most distinguished
anatomists on both sides of the Atlantic, and that we believe it to be the
only adequate illustration of the existing, wonderfully various manifestations
of the human mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it will afford us pleasure, and that we believe it will
be highly acceptable to this community, that Mr. Combe should make it
consistent with his arrangements in other cities, to give, during next
winter, another course in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee of seven gentlemen be appointed to
communicate to Mr. Combe a copy of these resolutions.</p>

<p>“The following gentlemen were accordingly appointed:—</p>

<p>“Samuel B. Wylie, D. D., Samuel George Morton, M. D., George
M’Clellan, M. D., Charles S. Coxe, Esq., Joseph Hartshorne, M. D.,
Thomas Gilpin, Esq., Thomas Fisher, Esq.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus have closed two most interesting and valuable courses of lectures
on phrenology in this city. Their reception has been of the most gratifying
character. Some may be disposed to think that their influence will
be of transitory effect, and that the interest will soon subside. But if
such should be the fact, it would be an anomaly in the history of the
science. Its principles have thus far proved too true, and too important,
to share such a fate. And they have fallen, we believe, into too many
and too able hands in this city to be so soon forgotten or easily neglected.
The interest in the subject has resulted, not from idle curiosity, nor the
mere excitement of feeling, but from the sober and deliberate exercise of
the intellect. And wherever the truth of such principles is firmly lodged,
there it will live, and its effects will be felt and seen.</p>

<p>We cannot but express a strong desire that Mr. Combe will favour the
citizens of Philadelphia with another course of lectures during the ensuing
winter.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Lectures of Rev. J. A. Warne.</i>—This gentleman has just closed in
this city, a course of six lectures upon the “Aspects of Phrenology on
Revelation.” This department of the science appropriately belongs to
the clergy. It is peculiarly <em>their</em> duty to investigate the moral and
religious bearings of every science, but more especially of one that professes
to unfold <em>the laws of mind</em>. And it would seem, that if any class
of persons ought to be thoroughly acquainted with such a subject, it is
the clergy. For their various duties lead them to deal almost constantly
with <em>mind</em>, and, of all others, <em>they</em> should understand its laws.</p>

<p>We are therefore gratified in seeing one of this profession engaged in
discussing the merits of phrenology, and showing that its principles are
not only not inconsistent, but in striking harmony with the truths of
Christianity. Mr. Warne is favourably known to the public as the
author of a chapter on the harmony between phrenology and revelation,
appended to a Boston edition of “Combe’s Constitution of Man.”
These lectures have been attended by an audience, very respectable both
as to numbers and character. The subjects of the different lectures were
handled in an able manner. That our readers may better understand
their nature, we give below the leading topics discussed.</p>

<p>It was the object of the lecturer to show, that phrenology does not
teach materialism, nor fatalism, nor infidelity, either atheistical or
deistical; but that, on the contrary, it furnishes arguments refutatory of
each of these errors, and even affords advantages in assailing them, not
elsewhere found; that this science does not deny or destroy human
accountability, or teach the <em>irresistibility</em> of motives, but <em>demonstrates</em>
man to be a free agent, by proving him to possess all the conditions of
liberty—viz. <em>will</em>, <em>plurality of motives</em>, and <em>power over the instruments</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of voluntary action; and, consequently, he <em>is</em> and <em>must</em> be accountable
for his conduct.</p>

<p>The lecturer proceeded also to show, that the Scriptures agree with
phrenology in classifying the faculties of man into moral sentiments,
intellectual faculties, and animal feelings; that they invest, as phrenology
does, the moral sentiments with the dominion; that they recognise
and address the respective faculties which phrenology has ascertained to
belong to our nature; and that the principles of this science are in harmony
with the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, such as human
depravity, indwelling sin, regeneration, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is, to some extent, new ground, and as far as our knowledge extends,
no person in Europe, or in this country, has devoted so much
attention to this part of the science as Mr. W. And we are gratified in
being able to state, that he intends to prosecute the investigation of this
subject, as his other duties may permit, for some years.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Dr. Elder’s Address.</i>—We lately received a copy of an address, delivered
before the Penn Institute of Pittsburgh, Pa., February 28th, 1839,
by William Elder. It is truly encouraging to find so many friends and
advocates of our new science. It is now becoming the theme of many
public addresses and lectures, as well as leading articles in our regular
periodicals. There are also some who make a free use of its principles,
and very advantageously too, without employing its technical language,
or even giving due credit to the science. It is a fact, that whenever and
wherever truth on any subject is presented, in harmony with the principles
of phrenology, it will appear clearer, more consistent and convincing to
every mind, and consequently will be more powerful in its effects. It
is as certain as any mathematical demonstration can be, that if phrenology
is a <em>true interpretation</em> of human nature, that all truth connected
with mind, and presented in harmony with the laws of its correct interpretation,
must touch a cord that will vibrate in every person, though
perhaps feebler in some than in others. We have known many individuals
very much pleased, and even captivated by a certain production or
performance, and to affirm repeatedly that the subject was never discussed
before so clearly and satisfactory to their minds; but when they
were afterwards informed that it was treated upon <em>strictly phrenological
principles</em>, they are much surprised, and sometimes seem <em>mortified</em>.
How true, in spite of prejudice and opposition, is the Latin proverb—“<i lang="la">Magna
est Veritas et prævalebit</i>.”</p>

<p>But to return to Dr. Elder’s address. We have perused it with much
interest. It appears that this address was delivered before an association
of young men, formed for mutual improvement. The principal object
of the author was to unfold the great laws of mind, a knowledge of
which is so important to mental and moral improvement. A subject
more appropriate to the occasion could not well have been selected; and
how far the author succeeded in accomplishing his object, we shall take
pleasure in giving our readers an opportunity to judge for themselves,
by presenting several extracts in the next number of the Journal.</p>

<p class="tb">The article promised in our last, on the “Elementary Principles of
Phrenology,” is necessarily deferred till the next number.</p>

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
